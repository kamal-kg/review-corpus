its not worst at this price biiig disappointment .
i brought samsung s9 plus at 10k less price which is very good in display camera and performance .
this phone showing better features than s9 plus but actually its not given as said .
big disappointment by samsung .
plz dont buy if u see it as s10 catagory flagship phone .
performance and price wise it &apos;s a good to go phone .
satisfactory camera , awesome user interface and design .
like most the ois and ram management .
a perfect deal for those who want flagship specifications in all aspects , trust of samsung amd its camera is really a scalled up .
do go for this without any doubt in mind .

camera and battery works as expected .

my phone is never hang .
screen size is awesome and i am enjoying video very much .

a great budget phone .
full of features and light in weight .
rating is 4.5 from my side .
i &apos;ll deduct 0.5 for headphones which are average and on screen touch sensor &apos;s response .
thanks samsung for introducing the budgeted power pack performance phone .
a great reply to one plus 7 pro &amp; amp ; iphone xr .
killer phone from samsung .
only problem iam having is according to samsung this is a fast proccesor but i faced some issues regarding response in software when iam using multi apps .
phone is awesome , works pretty well , no lags , no issues .
its a beast at value for money price .
i have been using samsung galaxy note since over 8 years &amp; amp ; changed over to samsung galaxy s10 lite recently .
till no wi have not seen any issue with the product .
i can vouch for the camera quality .
overall the phone is fine but the one that i recieved had scratches right from the beginning on the screen which is very disappointing .
really a good experience and but there are some problems in earphone voice is not clear and acept of it everything is best in value for money .
the camera is certainly an advantage in this price segment .
the new ui is definitely better than last samsung phone &apos;s ui but still need to improve .
overall it &apos;s a great phone and definitely value for money in this price segment .
need more power battery drain out fast but the good thing is super fast charging .
this is the best phone which i have ever used .
really a value for money .
starting with camera - both primary and secondary camera is very good , in fact in low light also .
battery - the battery is also very good , with the mode of super fast charging it takes only 40 - 45 minutes to get fully charged .
performance - if we are buying something we want that it will be as per our expectation and this mobile is beyond the expectation as its charging is superfast its performance is also superfast .
this product looks awesome .
the battery longs last .
sd855plus is an added advantage for better graphics .
overall it &apos;s a great phone with everything at a fair cost .
awesome phone really wow with fast charging nd battery life .
perfect camera quality nd photo effects fabulous display nd great performance really in love with s10 lite thanks samsung nd flipkart .
good phone .
great consistent performance , reliable all day battery life , primary camera best in segment , big enjoyable display .
super excellent .
no complaints .
i &apos;m not missing iphone now .
camera is excellent .
specially live focus mode in artificial lighting may capture images like dslr .
in day light camera performance in good but in night video mode struggles .
performance wise its good and can compete with sd855 + nearly .
battery is good when in standby but drains fast when screen is on .
sf charger provided with the box can juice it up within an hour from 0-100 % .
one of the best phone from samsung .
camera is very bad , not at all recommended if camera is highest priority .
0verall nice smartphone but one problem is there , how to connect it with pc .
excellent mobile phone .
a premium look and finish .
no issue so far with almost a month of use .
a good purchase .
best .
great product from samsung .
finally something with flagship processor .
excellent camera pro mode is just awsmm .
playing pubg 4-5 hours a day battery consume only 20 % .
best display among all smartphones , overall good phone with a good battery back up , light phone .
i am writing this after 7 days usage and am really impressed .this phone rocks in all direction camera , battery , performance .
galaxy s10 lite is really a value for money phone .
if you have seen or used galaxy s10 / s10 + ( my sister has it ) then you can easily gauge that for this price , samsung has loaded almost all the features .
this is justifiable as samsung has to make this phone look different that s10 / s10 + .
the only con for me was that it has a big size which i did not expect before buying .
if you like big phones then buy it .
this phone is just a beast in all the way .
the only problem is that the phone gets heated fast and that is really annoying .
but all the other features like camera , performance , display etc are superb and value for money .
samsung india please do some updates for the heating issues in the phone .
works smooth and fast .
camera works fine for me ( being a rookie photographer ) .
battery life could have been better .
otherwise very nice phone in this price range with quality of samsung .
excellent product by samsung .
excellent performance with 8gb ram and 4500mah battery , run everything smoothly , top quality super amoled display , excellent camera .
a handson review after one and half month .
mobile looks great and give premium look .
battery is well and good .
no issues at all .

best mobile phone .
camera quality is awsome.display is just the best ever in any phone , speed is awesome .
best phone in this price range .
great camera .
battery performance also really good , once fully charged works for 2 days .
camera is great -even low light pics come amazing .
battery- great battery life , on heavy usage ( gaming + browsing + videos ) the fast charger charges the phone within 1 hour .
display- i feel the display is little dull , i have previously used s9 , so i find the the display to be duller than s9 .
but as compared to other phones in the segment , it is the same .
performance- is great , smooth multitasking , games being played at max settings by default , minimum heating .
worst battery backup .
superb phone .
on time delivery by flipkart .
overall experience excellent .
amazing phone .
excellent battery life .
very nice cameras .
night mode works quite well .
average selfie camera .
samsung cheated .
very cheap phone .
but price too high .
most of features are not available .
poor performance .

the product is awesome .
no lag .
photos are great with highly stabilised videos .
in display fingerprint sensor doesn &apos;t recognize fingerprint all the time .
all over a great product .
awesome look .
grand performance .
best buy for new commers to premium mobiles .
fingerprint scanner is worst of samsung s10lite .
vivo phone and mi phone have a better scanner actually nt better they have the best as compared to this s10 lite .
nice phone within this price range .
looks elegant , photo quality is very good .
back cover looks awesome specially the white one .
fast processer , touch is very good and smooth .
best in range .
best in class .
brilliant performance along with samsung &apos;s brand value .
definitely better than one plus 7t .
best experience .
awesome display and even better performance .
finger print sensor isn &apos;t working accurately , its taking 2 to 3 tyms to unlcok , screen quality is not as expected , plz do buy this phone .
seller will only replace with same model phone .
best phone ever with variety of features and low price , simply just incredible .
both to buy it .
best phone under such price range .
amazing display .
i brought this phone about 15 days ago .
and its working like awesum , too many features , smartphones are getting smart day-by-day .
look style , camera , charging capacity everything is up to mark .
for battery part i am little disappointed as 5000 mh battery is not running full day .
with advancement in science &amp; amp ; technology , applications &amp; amp ; other software are consuming battery much faster then its usage .
performance , display , battery , display , touch all excellent .
good phone in brought the phone for 2,00,000 .
excellent performance .
camera and performance of the phone is good .
i am happy to buy this product .
looks so beauty and works smooth as possible as .
thank you samsung for this wonderful masterpiece .

best in display .
overall a good samsung phone .
white variant is look ossam.suggested to buy .
camera- good .

very good .
this device is just amazing i bought it was launched on flipkart and i just loved the quality of device , quality of camera and yes the main part the display it is just amazing best mobile in 40k .

wonderful .
amazing display clarity .
first phone of samsung brand and i feel like it is beast .
its really a perfect smartphone as compare to oneplus .
amazing phone fro samsung and flagship performance on good price .
the fingerprint performance is slow .
the phone is having an appreciable performance .
the camera is excellent , the super amoled display is amazing , also the battery is best suited according to the phone and its need , the snap dragon 855 is a cherry on top , all the features are amazing .
the speakers seem inadequate to the phone &apos;s price though still better than usual , also the onscreen finger print scanner is a bit troublesome sometimes .
the phone has many pros and very few cons , a must buy phone if you have the budget of 40k o .
best smartphone user friendly awesome performance and photography and long lasting battery life .
its really nice phone , i am enjoying the display , camera , battery life and the performance of my new samsung s10 lite .
its really far better than what i expected , thanks to flipkart and samsung .
was previously a oneplus customer for the past 4 years and prior to that i was a galaxy s user who loved my first android experience through it .
to my honest opinion , samsung has brought up its game to the next level with bringing in budget smartphones with snapdragon chipsets .
good phone with a brilliant display .
the processor is snapdragon 855 which is not the latest processor in the market but is still one which lets you function without any lags .
overall a really good purchase .
the product has excellent features like voice command , photo capturing , screen short and corp. its battery has very good performance .
display and other features are very attractive and eye catching .
touch effect in fingerprint is minutely low but overall it &apos;s a very good product in this price .
this is definitely a value for money .
i refer this phone in this budget .
i &apos;m one among them who uses internet pretty badly for office stuff , meetings , social networking etc .
it &apos;s been 2 months so far i didn &apos;t face any application hang issues and i don &apos;t have any complaints .
coming to the camera , it &apos;s sooo perfect and picture quality is awesome .
to put it in a single sentence worth for money .
i loved this phone .
it feels as a flagship phone .
best smartphone .
value for money .
great screen .
in display fingerprint sensor works very fast and accurately .
no other smartphone can match its battery standards .
one ui 2.0 is butter smooth .
and yes in box earphone is also pretty good .
superfast charger will mostly charge your phone within 1 hour .
apart from fingerprint unlocking and absense of dual speakers this phone is brilliant .
i am happy with s10 lite .
display , camera , battery , charging speed , in earphone sound quality , haptic feedback are excellent .
the sound quality of the earphone provided with the phone is also very good .
processor is already a beast from snapdragon .
gaming is smooth .
overall the phone is brilliant in its own way .
samsung has done a good job introducing the mid-high range flagship .
for buyers , its not a ga .
amazing product by samsung .
totally worth it .
been a samsung user from a long time .
this phone , one of samsung &apos;s flagships really meets it &apos;s expectations and competes with one plus 7 pro and beats it .
pros : amazing camera , multitasking , battery performance , fast charging , nfc , super smooth display .
ois is good .
cons : no 3.5mm jack , no dedicated memory card slot .
no depth camera .
if you want these go for samsung a71 at a much lesser price .
it &apos;s a great value for money phone .
its awesome mobile by samsung in all aspects except camera which did not meet expectations since while clicking pics there is less color contrast in the photos .
overall its best mobile under 40k and a true flagship mobile .
ultimate powerful mobile , very fast operation .
battery could be improved .
must buy .
in the price segment this is the best for ever .
performace of the phone is really good .
but they reduced the exchange price of my phn to a bare minimum , even if it was working fine .
mobile is very good .
if i talk about performance , its good at this range .
the only problem is with flipkart .
if you are exchanging your old phone , at the time of pickup they reduce the price inspite of the fact that the old phone is in very good condition .
awesome camera , powerful battery , superfast charging .
no lag gaming experience .
and above all awesome screen quality and exprience while watching videos and movies .
nice &amp; amp ; awesome mobile .
excellent combination of speed and battery backup , never experienced any lag , battery will easily leave upto 2 days , camera features are excellent , steady ois is working very well , i will recommend this phone for 39k budget .
super steady camera very impressive .
after using phone for approx 1 month .
positive : best product for young people especially pubg players best battery and play .
only negative i found is sound quality earphones .
the product was good and really worth the money , a flagship mobile with this cost is really worthable .
the most likely one is the camera and the battery with fast charging facility .
awesome product .
very much impressed with the product .
at last now we can recommend samsung because now the products are worth spending .
happy with the product and samsungs service .
very nice mobile .
camera quality is very good .
good battery life .
faster charging .
good to go for this mobile .
i like the my new galaxy s10 lite .
battery back is really good .
the best ever phone i have ever used .
best camera worth for this price .
speed , performance .
everything to the best .
2 . good camera ( front camera also delivers good images ) .
3 . one ui 2.0 , very smooth and provides various options of customisation .
5 . long battery life ( 1.5 days with average usage ) .
1 . slow and less accurate fingerprint scanner .
overall it is a good product .
true value for money .
really happy with this phone .
display and functions are good .
but am not happy with headphones .
while connecting with headphones lot of disturbance / noise is comming .
i bought prism white , everything &apos;s perfect for camera giving 4 as the hd is only available for 3 : 4 not for other screen ratio .
its should be available for each screen ratio .
rest everything is excellent .
camera is superb .
extra features are also good .
smooth gaming experience .
will get full charge in 1 hour .
little bit disappointment with fingerprint .
with one hand you can &apos;t use it .
sound quality is average .
if you are getting this phone around in 30k after applying all the offers ( exchange + icici ) then go for it , but not suitable in 40k .
a great phone with a hefty price tag .
the fingerprint sensor in s10 lite working very very worst .
need improvement this point otherwise it &apos;s ok .
better battery backup .
awesome display .
smooth &amp; amp ; fast .
worth for the price .
after all it is samsung .
battery drained super fast .phone hanged .
disappointed .
the great display .
super performance and amazing battery backup .
high performing phone , in face recognition there is some issue .
very good product .
thanks .
this device from samsung is just awesome .
be it design .
performance .
display .
camera or battery .
everything is just superb .
though the built quality could have been better with an aluminium frame .
but glastic panel at the back also looks classy and gorilla glass protection at the front .
price can be more competitive though .
but overall the device is power packed and beautiful .
always love samsung phone .
thank you .
a very good spec device but the camera is a pro grade camera as advertise .
lightining is very important for the good quality pictures .
apart from the camera , it is a very good phone .
but you can find oneplus devices in same price range with better specs / performance .
i am just amazed .
everything about this phone is good till now except the call clarity .
superb performance .
crisp camera .
superb steady mode is just awesome .
gud battery life but 25w charger makes life easy .
cool hidden features inside .
light weight .
super mobile .
but price is very high compared to the other mobile .
processor seems to be doing a great job being said it &apos;s outdated but i can &apos;t find any drawbac .
the best phone you could get in 30k .
screen and ui experience is amazing .
battery holds for full day with wifi , gaming and videos .
one handed operation , edge panels and other unique features .
no heating issues .
playing while charging generates minimal heat which is slightly noticeable .
been using for a week and didn &apos;t find any .
good mobile phone .
just moved from one pluse to samsung .
too much feature .
wonderful .
nice .
camera is not up to the mark .
fingerprint sensor not working properly .
large battery with superfast charging is amazing .
performance is decent .
main camera , supee wide angle camera , and selfie cameras are wonderful .
macro camera is not much of the use at most of the time .
android 10 based software along with samsung native apps is a good combination .
happy with the performance .
great value and features coming along with samsung .
nice phone but a bit overpriced .
25-30k price range would make it irresistible .
no complaints till now .
excellent performance in terms of , .
display .
battery .
speed .
awesome features at this price .
bought this at 28.2k after exchange and all discounts .
big value for money product from samsung .
never wanted to but with exynos processor and when this was launched with snapdragon 855 it was must buy products .
great display , camera battery and quite fast processing .
battery gets charged in 45 mins to 100 .
great phone from a tier-1 brand at a reasonable price .
didn &apos;t want the wireless charging or class leading camera at additional cost .
didn &apos;t want their samsung processor either .
can say that i was waiting for samsung phone with sd flagship processor at competitive price .
not worth buying .
camera is not good .
purchased this flagship phone of samsung .
i am really satisfied by the performance of my phone and it &apos;s camera quality .
thanks to samsung and flipkart .
over hyped .
camera is good but still needed more and more improvements .
the charger and headphone slot is same and its not jack type , its usb type .
this is a disadvantage .
over all i would say much better can be done at 40k .
one plus 7t is much much better on comparison .
samsung s10 lite got this product in prism white .
after lots of research in youtube and flipkart got mixed feeling regarding premium quality of the phone .
below are the points that i like most .
1 ) awesome battery back with power cap of 4500 mah and fast charging work more than one day even after heavy usage ( refrain from always on display ) .
after my 2 week usage .
best value for money device from samsung .
battery backup is awesome .
gorgeous display .
snapdragon 855 doing their job perfectly .
not facing any issues in performance .
one ui performance is really good im not expected .
over all value for money device .
thanks to samsung .
superb mobile in this range but only need to improve finger sensor quality .
best mid range flagship from samsung .
snapdragon chipset takes the performance out of the league .
camera needs to be improved .
1.the snaps clicked are mind blowing though sometime you need to control the exposure to get the best snap .
you get a full pro mode option where you can control all settings .
2 . the display is super amoled so no question about it .
3 . the only thing i am still struggling is to get used to its form factor .
the earlier phone of mine was having a 4.7 inches screen so it will take a while to get adjust with this phone .
i was an one plus user for almost 2 years .
compared with one plus s10 lite has a very poor system performance .
within less than 15 days of usage phone keeps hanging in between , takes time to load previously opened apps .
in screen finger print is so had that it doesn &apos;t recognize finger print .
i suggest not to for for this phone with a budget of 40k .
awesome phone from samsung .
better value for money than 1 + .
one ui from samsung is best in market .
display is wow factor .
855 processor is gamble .
no proper case available in the market .
not sure why .
verdict : just go for it &apos;s rocking phone from samsung .
thanks flipkart as always you are on time .
good performance .
very little weight .
awesome phone from samsung .
best you can get at this price .
oneplus doesn &apos;t stand in front of this phone in terms of camera quality specially the video .
also the screen display if far better than oneplus with the super amoled screen .
if you are looking to buy a camera phone go with this phone .
look guys , its a nice phone .
don , t just compare its a sleek design handy and you will get all the features as per this budget .
one thing that i would like to highlight , while exchanging my old phone , the guy who came to take it , said that my phone body is defaulted so i will have to pay 2300 to him in cash .
i gave him cash , then i saw he didn &apos;t enter those details in his mobile , i think he bluffed me .
this is a very negative side which i have seen from flipkart .
how they can keep these type of people .
flipkart should look into this matter .
guys you also beware from these type of people .
excellent phone for the price , screen is slightly better than the one plus 7t .
camera is not working .
rest overall a good device .
good phone .
very good option to go for it .
a must buy if u wish to go for this range .
what a dynamic phone .
this time .
amazing performance .
thanks samsung .
it is one of the best phone in all segments .
only wish , the price was around 35k .
worth buying phone in this range .
6.7 inch display is best super amoled display .
its smooth and camera is great .
battry backup too poor only 3 hour in pubg or cod go for other brands like mi or poco .
i preordered this phone and using since 6 feb so i will give it 4.2 star for following details .
1.camera : super camera with steady videos and also for night photography .
it works awesome in artificial light as well as day light all you need to understand its settings .
just awesome and smooth experience af .
camera is also good and battery life is good .
overall best performance you should definitely go for it .
it , s worth to buy .
fast and smooth performance .
impressive cameras .
no ip rating .
real flagship phone , best in camera and performance .

samsung is done great job good-phone at better price with lots of features .
don &apos;t buy worst samsung mobiles at any price .
worst mobile ever .
i am amazed at the level of specs samsung has provided for a decent low price .
got it after exchanging my galaxy s7 and additional cashback .
and the adaptive brightness is also very quick and responsive .
the face unlock feature is amazing .
and the snapdragon 855 just adds in the performance category .
samsung should continue manufacturing these kinds of range phones .
good and the best .
very smooth and has great battery life .
this is the samsung phone i have been waiting for .
previously i was using a9 .
s10 lite is better than .
a9 in all aspects .
the camera is wonderful .
battery easily lasts for 36 hours .
phone from samsung after note2 which was my .
favorite .
camera is very good but one plus camera is better .
battery is very good .
i am too much happy with performance .
but screen is not as i had expected .
it took scratch by just putting in my pocket .
but the exchange offer is not at all convincing .
amazing phone .
you will have no regret .
pretty good product .
coming to performance it &apos;s beast .
waste of money .
very poor quality censors .
wow it is wonderful and best phone .
super performance .
samsung is again coming to competition with oneplus with this phone .
i would say , this is the best smartphone you can get under 40k .
everything works like a charm .
when you type in the keyboard , you will get the best feeling .
i have used many phones android , iphones , one plus .
but this one is seriously amazing phone .
dont think about it , just hmgo for it .
there is a great deal going in flipkart for thi .
every thing is good but the fingerprint sensor is very slow samsung have give focous on it .
fingerprint print sensor not rensponding at single time .
for fingert print rating is 2 star .
superb mobile and performance .
on time service from flipkart .
exceptional .
except flat screen .
excellent display and sound quality .
i got this phone on 5th feb.
i shifted from one plus 5 to samsung s10 lite .
amazing screen .
great camera ( both front and back ) .
good sound quality .
you need not to carry any battery backup with you .
ui is fresh and new with no bloatware at all .
you won &apos;t regret after buying this beauty .
best value for money with flagship processor &amp; amp ; camera .
the product is worth the money considering the exchange and card discount it provides .
the images from the camera are awesome and the display is really cool along with its colour .
other feathers such as samsung pay , hand gesture for selfie is really advanced .
128 gb of storage in-built .
great size , .
and the trust of samsung .
i am glad that the phone stands in all aspects .
the screen size le .
awesome mobile with some good features like snapdragon chip , triple cam .
just go with it .
one sentence review : flagship performance at budget price .
camera and display is excellent .
just go for it .
better battery .
over all every thing is fine in this device .
price also ok in this range .
phone was good .
camara quality is good , but missing the telephoto lens .
sceen quality is also great .
battery is also good .
build up is ok . daily performance is good .
network reception in ok , not that great .
but wifi calling is a great option .
one more issue , not able to screen mirroring with sony android tv , don &apos;t know what is the issue .
samsung the king of smartphone &apos;s forever .
one of the best mobile from samsung .
best flagship phone and great performance .
best flagship from samsung better than oneplus 7t .
what else you need from a flagship and that too coming from samsung .
waited 6 months to make a decision for my new device , finally fully satisfied for money i spent .
final verdict- guys if you are planning for oneplus 7t .
samsung galaxy s10 lite is surely a flagship killer .
the display is simply gorgeous , the optical fingerprint sensor is convenient , performance is flawless , and the one ui 2.0 is an interface i admire .
moderate phone and nothing exceptional .
need to explore more before final review .
2 . excellent battery life .
5 . value for money .
2 . no wireless charging .
awesome camera and display .
worth buying this phone at this price .
days of usage : 12 .
camera : it is good , i wouldnt say great .
it would just last a day .
i was expecting more considering the specs .
an update may help .
screen : amazed with screen .
although very big it &apos;s an ease to operate .
full mark .
camera is fairly good .
superb mobile at this price range .
display the best in sunlight .
in comparison to these prices , this is best phone in respect to battery , display , design .
great phone with fast sd 855 processor , good cameras , screen etc .
fingerprint sensor is also good .
no problems so far is noticed .
fast charging is also available .
and battery easily would last for a day .
overall a great phone by samsung for the price .
excellent camera both rear and front cam is awesome .
no edge for this mobile .
remaing all are awesome .
if your not looking for edge this is best in samsung .
it is not seems like premium because of no edge .
hope samsung brings more of snapdragon in future .
used my old phone and extra bank cashback to bring the price around 23k which was a steal , so happy happy happy .
best thing about this one is the large amoled screen .
watching hd qualities movies on this phone is a bliss .
performance wise also this does not lack anything .
opening and scrolling through the apps is very smooth .
battery lasts more than a day with extensive usage with both the networks on .
chrarging is pretty fast .
battery back up very nice with smoothly fast charging .
but camera quantity is poor .
nice phone in this price .
phone display quality is good but camera is not good and sound quality is very bad .
after research one month i buy this phone .
at this price point this is the best value for money .
overall it is the good package .
best mobile , but display not good .
good product but camera isn &apos;t so good .
good but price high .
value for money i loved the product .
excellent this is product .
awesome phone , best camera , display and performance .
mobile is in apt size and light weight .
i am using this phone since last two months and quite satisfied .
the best in phone in this range .
after trying so many time screen got woke up .
thanks for purchasing this device .
feeling so bad experience .
its an awesome phone in the given price range .
i am quite impressed with the camera quality and the modes available in camera .
pros : good camera quality in day and mild light conditions .
display gives a premium feel .
battery backup is really good which last till more than a day .
performance is excellent as i haven &apos;t seen any lag so far though i am not a gaming buff .
look and feel is like a premium phone .
cons : camera quality is not up to the mark in low light conditions .
best camera , best processor , best battery , and as well as best display also .
mobile is awesome but its cost to me 16990 but within one month the price was so drop .
this phone is absolutely worth the money .
i will go straight to the pros and cons .
2 ) front camera is top notch .
3 ) rear camera is good .
5 ) haptic feedback is just perfect .
i have both of these phones in my home .
9 ) feels really comfortable holding the phone .
10 ) looks just like a premium phone .
no show other app for dual app so please fix it .
when i bought this phone i thought it was one of the best in this price range .
but after using for a month i am facing lot of issue .
first of all the phone is hanging quite a lot of time after some random using .
even 48mp camera is not that much worthy .
battery drains out very fast .
performance is also okay okay type if you have used realme xt or redmi note 8 pro then you will feel that this price is too much .
selfie camera performace is good rather than rear camera .
most of the mobile phone .
excellent performance , nice camera , overall is good .
very nice phone and aswome camera .
display , battery and sound very good camera also but camera need updates .
camera very bad condition .
only bad is lack of space for external memory card .
i bought this mobile in big billion sell i got this to 17k which is affordable for me .
good camera good display .
camera is not good very bad filipkart .
awesome phone and good camera .
very very best phone .
touch quality need to be more smooth .
good camera quality but one problem on this phone that is only 2 slot which is for sim not any slot for sd card .
and display is not good quality because 3gp and 4 gp video running with very crack pixcel .
video calling quality is poor .
i will suggest vivo to provide a dedicated sd card slot with it.that will make the phone vivo z1x more faster after 1 or 2 years or the storage will be full and it will lack up the phone .
it &apos;s a good value for money phone .
phone is fully loaded .
delivery is correct time .
camera night mode is not better .
and in night mode flash does not work .
phone is good , but when browsing gives hitting issue .
15k phone but not having sd card slot .
simply awesome go for it best under 15k .
they mention in no cost emi options so .
one month before i bought this product .
some technical issues .
you have to pay merchant emi options is there in your bank side .
you will convert it and then you pay monthly with 14 % interest added .
i loss my money more then products budget .
don &apos;t buy the product with no cost emi option .
really cheating in flipkart .
great bye at this price point .
good product fast delivery money value .
good product and smart running this phone .
exceed expectations , loved it .
very good smartphone for long tram use .
great at this price range .
best for mid range smartphone .
performance cam and display are superb good battery life also with 22.5 watt fast charger i like this phone best phone under 16k i am happy with it .
internet is not constant , every time it disconnects while i am playing .
bulky and underperforming phone .
best camera quality and better look full satisfaction as same feeling of .
nice phone price is little high but camera and battery are awesome .
pleased with the gadget .
camera quality is awesome in night and also low light dont think about hanging problem in vivo brand .

after getting vivo z1x and using 15 days it &apos;s completely satisfied my needs .
a fantastic phone with this price range .
phone is really awesome but one disadvantage is that micro sd slot is not there .
it is very broad .

in this mobile suitable for that cost but fornt flash is there .
i have choose this phone for photography , music , display , battery , storage 128 gb , 6gb ram performance , gaming .
all of this features a complete package phone and happy with attached headset .

i will only list the issues , therefore .
1 ) cannot mark messages and delete them all in once .
3 ) imges recognizer is useless , no useful results .

there are a few flaws in the phone though .
the user experience of the funtouch os is not that great .

unwanted pre-installed apps can be removed .

a very good product from asus , stock android making it more smooth
camera is getting better with latest ota updates
thumbs up to asus
only thing which disappointed me is price of this phone during sales
i bought this phone just before 15 days of flipkart big million day sale
i bought it for 15k
and in big million day sale it decreased to 13k
so if you want to buy this phone then wait for some sale
in almost every sale it &apos;s price got decrease
amazing product but not like 6gp ram
this mobile camera is bad and mobile ringing is totally waste ( totally wasted )
super product nice mobile
this mobile is very good in this price. i got this 6gb ram mobile @ १२९९९
hungs completly when game mode is on
little bit battery backup is not good as given with phone 5000 mah otherwise all good
it very best phone cheap price
like to give 4.3 because its blazing fast working does not match camera part at all which is not user-friendly .
i would prefer redmi note 5 pro over this fone while taking any snap .
best combination ever , worth the money .
amazing battery backup and display .
don ’ t recommend its cameras
good and best super product
i am using this phone from 5 months .
i have few problems to discuss on it .
2.phone is getting into silent mode automatically .
everything good to this mobile .
my love is asus zenfone max pro m1
cell is silent then again normal mode then silent and video calls sound is not sufficient
great mobile for the given price range .
it also don &apos;t give that natural look .
and not also very professional look .
don &apos;t by this product because 3months battery backup ok after some time battery backup will be down and also mobile hanging my 6 gb ram mobile . don &apos;t prefer this mobile
i love it , worth of money , battery backup great , camera 5 , worth of money
i &apos;m very satisfied with the product and with its performance .
the battery has a long life and without even quick charging the charge is superfast .
the only major concern is i don &apos;t get system updates quick which i don &apos;t consider as asus &apos;s fault .
overall good value for money and a great product .
best phone at this price with its features .
excellent battery back up of 2 days even after extensive use and superb speaker output .
no other phone in its price point offers such features .
i purchased 3 for my family .
great phone from asus .
sometimes it is geeting hang
there is no materials inside the box except charger
most expected value for money
camera is bad low light candition
very good phone with avg camera quality
asus zenfone max pro m 1 is very poor mobile
first of all , i would like to say that the touch pannel used in this device is cheap quality and very clumsy , of you are coming from any samsung or nokia smartphone then you will definately notice the difference .
and second , the battery is awesome
i have gone 2 days without charging the device but on heavy usage it lasts upto 1and a half day .
and performance is also okay okay
but much better than redmi note 5 pro .
awesome phone within ₹ ₹ 15000 .
satisfied with mobile and working smooth .
its an excellent phone .camera is also good.battery is awesome , it lasts for almost two days .
thank you flipkart for providing good product and the delivery service .
don &apos;t buy this phone every update fix past problem and create a new problem
only cons are :
1 ) glass breaks easily
i have purchased at diwali. but 4 days after its fingerscan locking stopped working properly .
some features not working as compared to other phones. bad experience after purchasing this phone. don &apos;t buy it. please .
good buy at this price .
battery backup and speed awsome
in my 4 days of use i found my device was losing signal
the phone came dead on arrival .
however it got charged after sometime and had been running normal .
at times the internet stops and needs a restart to work again .
now today 15th jan 2018 it went dead again .
does not switch on at all .
the battery was around 80 percent when it went dead and now not responding at all
good bt not best
super product good performance in all categories
fast delivered i like it
very happy , has everything !
battery is superb. no fast charging so possibly better battery life .
need to charge once a day .
no bloatware like the china phones out there .
this is totally stock android .
performance is fantastic being 6gb with a good processor .
extra sd card slot too .
very bad to screen lock opening
worst , software problem .
first of all thanks flipkart for faster delivery .
ordered on a saturday night 11pm , received on monday morning .
i am writing this review after 2 weeks usage .
great performance , battery backup is awesome .
2 days of battery backup is guarentee for a normal user .
no hangs , camera performance is average , low light camera performance is poor , selfie camera also average .
found some minor camera software issues , like &apos; cant open camera app &apos; hope they will fix it .
from order to delivery it was smooth like a knife on butter
asus worst ! phone specifications are good i ordered 6gb ram .it performance like 2 gb ram .too much heat .i &apos;m playing games getting too much heat .
update s are zero it is january still in november update .i m tried to do manual update .it doesn &apos;t updating .

awesome product.after latest update battery life is increased.camera quality is decent .
performance is giant .
amazing phone but camera quality low
thanks flipkart for giving my son best mobile phone
its awesome product but some futures are missing campair to other mi products
one of the worst android phone ever , worst performance
after 5 days use i &apos;m reviewing . .
great mobile. every thing is awesome. just camera quality is little bit different from my expectations but okk .
battery , sounds is unbeatable by any phone
battery is not good
phone is not that good. you will have multiple software issues and camera is seriously pathetic .
finger print sensor will stop working after sometime .
only performance is good but rest all sucks .
everything is good but fingers sensor problem after a month
have to develop signal drop issue
best phone at best price .
mobile off automatically after charging always
wonderful device ever seen .
lucky model for me
6gb @ 13k is more valuable for money superb
battery not upto the mark.charge draining quickly. battery not even for one day usage with full charge. have to charge twice. rest all superb
fast and prompt delivery from flipkart .
not well . hanging problem
such a rubbish product , i &apos;ve using it for 5 months now , and the performance started degrading after 15 days , and the display is acting up , battery hardly lasts , in all not value for money .
best features budget mobile
great phone , battery life is awesome
sound and speakers are very good .
speed is also excellent .
my exchange order is cancelled by the agent , although the old mobile was tested but he cancelled the same at his own wish for which i caused damages .
camera , display , sound , battery , speed , .everything is good .
working very good in this price range
best phone bought .
performance in terms of gaming is even better than x. really worth for money .
don &apos;t wait just buy it
i never expect this type of worst phone from asus .
asus lost of customer credibility .
loud and clear sound , powerful processor snapdragon 636 , no heating issues even after intense gaming , impressive battery backup ( 5000mah ) .
camera quality is poor ( both front and back ) , fingerprint scanner is bit slow , auto brightness does not work properly , no gorilla glass protection , screen gets easily scratched , tempered glass is recommended .
nice smartphone on this price having great ram with good storage .
nice delivery by flipkart .
fast delivery and good product .
battery life is not worth as 5000mah
awesome battery , awesome performance , awesome camera
except camera other things are excellent .
headphone jack wasnt working right out of the box , unless it is kept completly still on a table even a slight movement will make it not work .
i have tried more than 4 headphones but the issues are still present
awesome product tnx flipcart
my asus zenfone max pro m1 &apos;s age 15 days only .
but tuch skin in not working .
very bad camera voice not at all clearand flipkart don &apos;t sell this type of mobile
fine but desr buyers don &apos;t buy after using mi mobiles this is totally different
standard delivery and good quality
flipkart is giving the worst service to the customers .
i am facing issue on display and i was complaining about my issue for 2 weeks , but they are not even caring the problem that i &apos;m facing .
there are no strong replacement policies .
all they are showing us is fake policies .
please guy &apos;s please don &apos;t trust flipkart and their policies .
headset not received in box
at this price this is just awesome phone
there &apos;s not a better phone than this within ₹ 18,000 .
display could have been an amoled , but i ain &apos;t complaining .
back camera is just terrific .
front camera is just as good , but adds a smooth filter to every picture .
truely satisfied , you can see other people reviwes . ( except hotspot does not have 5ghz facility ) , but hotspot has 2.4ghz .
because this is a budget phone under rs 15k .
if it does not have 5ghz in hotspot , i have no issues .
keep if flip cover was free .
along with the mobile
had ordered last i.e in nov , just close your eyes and go for it trust me its smart phone out of all phone i will rate this product one number one
feature excellent click speed excellent .
battery is best . camera wow .

battery drain very fast , every software update make mobile miserable even camera
not very good but ok
excellent phone in 13 k range
amazing incredible asus camera battery etc super i love it
good phone for that value
very good product for money .
the battery performance is not as good as a 5000 mah should be .
it does not have video call feature .
no updates on software .
overall i &apos;m not happy with the product .
better looking and better performance products can be found at this price .
its nice mobile in lowest price
i am really disappointed .
brightness not working properly.hanging problem .camera quality not good.slow processer.navigation bar not comfortable .
this price range is good one
fine. fingerprint little bit low quality
6gb ram with 64gb storage in re.13999 / -. very satisfied . 5000 mah battery superb .
the phone is excellent performance wise , softwarewise.but camera is not that good .
asus zenfone max pro m1 just mind blowing .
battery backup excellent. camera is better
nice phone at this price range .
very good this phone thank you i am happy
ordered last night and received it at 4pm today .
phone is full paisa vasool , very light even having 5000mah battery .
does not support jio native video calling
camera is not upto the mark compare to note 5 pro. but i have no problem
third quality mobile asus .
normal quality but delivery is nicely done by delivery man
camera quality not good
third class or even say no class mobile .
get cheated by buying this product .
flipkart is also cheating the customers by selling third class products on their sites and do not refund the money and do not satisfy their customers .
i am sure that everyone would love this phone .
the design and camera should be better .
super mobile in this price you can trust and buy it. just go for it
network speed not show
bad finger print loke
very good product , velue for money .
after first software update , phone got hanged .
and was suggested to factory reset ( entire 64gb internal ) for better performance .
software complaint , ui is not responding .
some time phone switched off .
camera performance is very poor .
no where stand in comparison of redmi note 5 pro .
xiaomi is the best .
superb mobile , 100 % value for money .
battery gets charged in 2 hours and lasts more than one day on intense usage .
display is vibrant and bright even in sunlight , camera is superb but not good in low light condition .
no problem of lag or heating .
loudspeaker is loud and gets boosted in maxbox provided by asus .
i will strongly recommend everyone to buy this smartphone .
suddenly got bank screen , not getting any display on 16th feb 2020 .
please don &apos;t buy it
very good economical phone for the price .
i got value for my money and i &apos;m happy .
camera is a bit off , but battery and performance is awesome .
it is a great all-rounder .
best value for money .
quality can be enhanced even further by using google camera .
slow motion video , finger print camera shutter requires third party app .
the integrated graphics card , adreno 509 is excellent for gaming .
the phone is just awesome . it is more look in real than in images shown . great battery backup and performance .
full value for money .
amazing delivery by flipkart .
you can play pubg 6 hours straight
great buy under 15k
battery is extremely good
the phone feels a bit heavy in hand bcoz of the large battery
it &apos;s a performance beast
camera not up to the mark
speed of fingerprint unlock can be improved
don &apos;t think just go for it .
not bad if i compare money and features .
i have no time to write so much things .
but in short its money valuable .
it is struckking very much so , please don &apos;t prefer .
after using 4 month i am giving my review .
1. pretty good display . 4 out of 5
2. overall performance including software and hardware , ram management , gaming , multitasking etc. just outstanding . 5 out of 5
3. design and build quality is pretty well with metal finish
4. big 5000 mah battery which lasts a full day for heavy usage and 1and 1 / 2 or 2day for modarate usage
battery is no doubt awesome .
camera of the 6 gb variant is better than 4 gb variant .
display is good actually .
but fingerprint sensor is little bit slow .
that &apos;s all i have experienced .
nothing to say. fabulous product from asus
not given declared warranty at ₹ 99 .
best in this price range against rn5 pro .
camera little bit disappoint .
snapdragon camera app is not a perfect camera ui .
phone looks slim as compared to rn5 pro .
speaker volume is loud .
display clarity better than other phones in this segment .
12999 price is great .
best phone under price tag
perfect one. i just love asus .
it is better than note 5pro and note 6 pro
the beast at best price !
in this price range definitely go for it !
it just lacks ir sensor for remote control !
rest all is well !
good phone in budget range
osam in this rate
camera results very nice. phone is so so good. must buy
does not have own music player or file manager .
can not change theme
and flipkart not exchange this phone so pls don &apos;t buy and don &apos;t waste your money .
the product is nice , extremely well back up of battery .
running without any difficulty .
sensor not working most of time .
this phone display performance is chinese phone
camera quality needs to be improved .
except this the phone is true value for money .
fingerprint lock is not working properly
battery backup awesome. value for money
not good battery problem .
awesome phone thanks flipkart
probably the wisest decision when it comes to phones. very happy with the performance and quality .
delivery was before schedule and packaging was excellent .
superb battery life , performance well , simply hold in hand and pocket , without lacking it is working fine.but not satisfied with camera
fabulous phone under 15000 .
using it more than a month now .
1. good battery life .
easily goes a day without charging .
2. easy and smooth operating system .
pubg is playing nicely .
1. no gorilla glass
2. bad camera , flash doesn &apos;t work sometime
s / w updates are not good enough like other mobiles in this price range .
need a lot of improvement in software section .
nice phone go for it .
functionally the mobile is good but who wants android pai version don &apos;t buy .
from asus end they dont have updated android os .
excellent value for money .
very nice product i love this mobile
performance of battery not matching the specification of 5000 .previously i used asus zenfone max .
having same battery which sustains for 2-3days.but this mobile battery drains quickly within 1-2 days
except this compare to price good specification mobile at good price
don &apos;t think and make a smart decision .
no other reputated brand is providing such features in this price .
i am 100 % satisfied .
value for money phone. only camera should have been better
nice price worthy phone
writing this after 65 days of using it , complete value for money and fully satisfied with it &apos;s performance , no heat , no lagging , good product .
i give this feedback after using 15 days .
hi all don &apos;t buy this phone from flipkart .
this 2nd time i have given to service centre .
keep on issue is coming .
this is really waste phone from asus and flipkart .
pop up add are irritated me alot customisation not available , call diaper is not good , no call recording , else ok
camera quality is not well
need to improve on front camera .
anyway it &apos;s good product to buy below 15k .
great phone according to money but have a some problem
but phone is great
this is the awesome phone i have ever seen it has all functions what you want and it &apos;s battery is also awesome
best smart phone ever .
have been using this phone for 4 months .
but now the fingerprint sensor is lagging .
perfect mobile under 15000rupees .
i used this phone for about 1 week .
n now i can operate anymore n it &apos;s a waste of money n i thouht that i am lucky to have this phone but now it suck
very good phone and easy to use .
value for money and delivery is also fine , within described timeline .
battery performance is extraordinary.camera should be little bit improvised .
i am using this product for 3 months now .
considering the performance of the processor its very good there and have no lag or whatsoever , battery backup is also appreciable , mobile is little bit heavy because of 5000mah battery inside of it .
performance is good , the inly oroblem i am facing is its camera .
don &apos;t delay to buy , experience the joy of using hybrid mobile .
non stop gaming mobile
camera average other things are great
nice mobile guys enjoy this
does not have selfie flash
the only defect i found was that the camera it have has a lower performance than expected. but its ok .
it can be neglected .
battery life is really fantastic .
a very good choice !
too much awesome phone , too big display for first time , easy to use , powerful backup , stunning sound , clear vision
good phone best price
awesome phone for heavy users but don &apos;t expect camera quality .
otherwise performance and battery life good value for money .
great specs and performance at this price .
good product by asus it looks premium in hands but it &apos;s a little heavy due to its massive battery size .
charging is very slow. and my charger gt spoiled just aftr 1 week .
except this phone is great
camera not ok battery not ok i love asus bt this is bad bt love asus
performance not up to the mark
i dont think i should rate the only value for money product here .
yes. basically am asus lover. had zenfone max. i simply upgraded to this product .
such a brilliant prdct. little bit disappointing in camera section .
but i should say ok. all the other specs are brilliant. didnt faced any lag till now .
9th day load speaker got problem. after 1hr it starts working normally .
overall everything s good
6gb is a better choice over 3 / 4gb , go for it .
camera and battery is good
new phone doesn &apos;t turn on .
black screen shows up when checked online about this issue it is common issue for max pro m1 .
when asked for replacement technical person visit he asks us questions like why this is not turning on what you have done .
this year i ordered 2phones from flipkart received defect phones and replacement need to wait for 2-3 days extra
flipkart and sellers waste time and questions as if we do wrong
perfect value for money .
could not have got cheaper a 6 gb ram phone .
asus phone cameras were always good .
but this time sound quality is also better than zenfone previous models .
always use and recommend
the device is best
the device is ok and decent in performance .
images in motion is difficult to be captured and no panaroma option is available .
one unexpected drawback that i am facing now is the performance of the fingerprint sensor .
its response sometimes is very slow or doesn &apos;t function at all and force us to use other means of unlocking .
yes it is great product .
i am recommending the 6gb variant .
the performence and the feedback are great .
good battery life too .
stock android ( latest android updates )
premium build quality ( metal body )
i really like this awesome smartphone .
i personaly recommend this phone for
those who need value for money .
battery draing very fast
nice mobile but display size length long
but width is not long
don &apos;t buy this fingerprint is not working after 2 months
i got 1 day delivery thank you flipkart .
excellent product , awesome battery backup .
would recommend people to purchase this product who wants bigger battery .
super duper battery backup and good performance
gd but little bit hang prblm
not sure about others .
but the product which i received was fabulous .
i love it overall .
light using no problem
6 gb ram working fast this phone hanging software problem
battery backup not gud , video calling option available but .
it &apos;s not functioning properly .
it &apos;s a good mobile except camera .
but if u are a selfie lover then don &apos;t even think about it .
either u take 16mp or 12mp variant , it is very very bad for camera .
when u zoom your pic .
great mobile , working fine , no heating problem .
good and worth full
i really proud to buy this one .
camera is not satisfied for me
i have to use this phone 7 days after my experience this phone awesome in my best price 11699 .
this phone is valuable money in sufficient
it is soft and power full
mobile is perfect. but i did &apos;nt get headset
not made for photoholics .
please provide fast charging and direct video call in next update
really awesome producttttttttt superrrrr
such a awesome product .
i was planned for some other famous brand .
excellent product and flipkart .
budget product and video quality very gud but camera quality is not gud .
awesome product under this price
excellent battery camera can be more improved value for the money
when i get this replaced than the battery was falling down very much faster
not up the mark
super phone and super brand .
appearance is good but battery is draining fast ofcourse it &apos;s all about the usage .
camera also not upto the mark .
camera is good enough for normal usage .
but if you want to take mobile photos more professional it doesn &apos;t serve the purpose .
the default camera app doesn &apos;t even have grid lines option .
thought it will be added via update but they didn &apos;t .
also there is an issue of restarting while using camera continuously for sometime or while recording videos .
i am surprised about this issue as i am using a 6gb variant .
no electronic image stabilization .
1. performance is somewhat good because of combination of 6gb ram and processor .
2. display is good .
camera is the lowest quality camera ever .
on this point you &apos;d definitely regret if you buy this .
2. music output on bluetooth devices is poor .
3. battery drains like it &apos;s 2000 mah .
not even giving 1 day backup with normal uses .
trust me , if you buy this , you &apos;ll regret .
i &apos;m very much disappointed with this device .
killer phone got it for 1300 .
new beast is arrived with value of money
much better than the so called brands .
i am completely satisfied for what i have got .
hope this review helps others to take a wise decision .
value for money smartphone .
i got it in rs 13k
not happy with the product , mother board crashed after using it for 3 months .
and battery life is also third class .
good for nothing value for money
camera is not enough good then battery doesn &apos;t shows 5000maph power and performance is excellent
too good must buy
no native video call .
only and biggest drawback
delivery was not satisfied , dey didnt talk properly with customers. disappointed
best phone in this price range with really good camera , with 6 gb ram , very good battery backup , android 8 .
superb phone with two days battery standby .
overall very happy with the purchase
i really liked it
its a very nice phone .
looks and quality very gud
nice phone superb features. in low budget
very nice product in this price .
a great device. the 6 gb variant is very smooth and battery life is really good .
the device it self is rsally good to use. no heating issues at all .
screen is really good in outdoor condition also .
overall good stock android experience .
very much happy with the features of the phone
also if you love tweaking your phone with custom rom and rooting then you will find lot of developers on xda forum .
all over is good but i am note little satisfy this asus .
i like is realme 2pro mobile
best deal for me thanks to # flipkart for this deal nest performance too
the ring tone goes to silence on its own .

below the standards of asus , not at all satisfactory
all is well except camera
i think this is the best phone in this range .
ofcourse redmi note 5 pro is a tough competitior .
but its pictures are not doing justice to the reality .
ofcourse it is pleasing to our eyes , but i prefer originality of the pictures .

overall i am very much satisfied .
gud phone amazing battery good display and good performance but no customisation due to stock android camara is not bad but need more improvement speaker is good loud sound
excellent phone at this price worth of money
awesome deal from flipkart
this is an awesome phone with fast processing and long battery life .
though i cannot boast off about the front camera and screen quality , this phone is the only phone i felt worth for money .
my suggestions for m1 to become a complete phone is as follows .
add autofocus to front camera .
2. convert led screen to amoled .
3. convert front screen glass to gorilla glass .
awesome fone as you know already , superb power , value for money , love it
super phone . but unfortunately the day after i placed the product order. the price of this phone is reduced to 12000 by offer : d
camera is very good actually some pics are beautiful and fabulous
battery is the main fact of buying. its really very satisfying but .
actually it might do a lot better by software tweaks .
performance wise its really satisfied .

i writing this review after 4 months of using
pros : fantastic batter life , last for 1 full day that is 24 hrs and not working hours
though not very good but can &apos;t expect more from a 15k phone
nice display , perfect size to fit in palm
specs are great in this price range .
satisfy with overall working .
camera is good but not user friendly .
a problem observed in screen , it black out some time when power button on .
wifi only works if the screen is on , poor performance while calling , screen gets on automatically and press mute button .
not recommend to buy this phone

very good mobile i like it more money
mi note 5 pro is batter than this
it &apos;s a good phone .
but after update camera lags a little bit
its very nice within 15k
want insurance for phone .
i like flipkart service excelent product i am very happy
best at this segment .
one of the best smartphone in this price range. huge battery. great performance. camera is slightly on lower side but it is still good though and has improved after new update
after using 2months , i am very happy with product
rear camera is very poor
battery quality is good. like 2 day with internet use. i bought in rs .
only battery is bad rest everything is outstanding
thank you flipkart delivery
battery superb. cam average , sound quality super
phone is good , but sim ejector missing in box
the 2nd one is in the low light
its very nice product under 15k .
all overy very nice product , using from last 7 months .
guys , don &apos;t go with the name. it &apos;s a great phone with value for money. don &apos;t try to compare with other phones like mi as they are different from this phone. plus , the company listens to all its issues .
i &apos;ve never seen updates as frequently as asus does too clear all the bugs
very worth mobile , trustble mobile , awsome mobile
good and perfect order
best in class no lag in high end gaming worth of 15k
after using it for a month
battery - a full day backup after high gaming like 5-6 hrs of pubg and 1-2 hrs of asphalt nitro
use some apps for better pics like b612 .
processor - snapdragon 636 gives a great performance and with gud graphics and rendering in pubg .
display - quite bright display , no problem in day time .
i got it in rs .
value for money this phone is with 6gb ram 64gb internal storage with 52.5gb available .
the mobile is just wow .
than going for max pro m2 , ppl can prefer this in 6gb variant as that does it &apos;s work in a very perfect manner and also in a limited cost.no issues , except camera .
i hope asus will rebuild it using the bugs fix updates .
apart from this , no doubts , you can buy without second thoughts .
contacts display problem not all the contacts are displaying and what about the screen shot and no app lock provided
battery life is the best and prime feature of this phone .
display is pretty good as well .
camera is more than average .
however i was expecting much better performance as the mobile is built with 6 gb of ram
everything is perfect about this handset but sometimes the phone is facing hang issues .
all all performance is well but battery performance is something average
awesome phone by asus
i can safely say this after using it for a few months now .
flipkart , thanks a lot for always delivering the right product on right time .
you are unmatched in electronics category as per me .
starting two months battery wonderful but next month bettery weak
nice mobile with good features in low budget .
waste this phone please don &apos;t buy
very nice. worth the price
i am absolutely enjoying what i got .
at this price , way better than competition .
certainly better than mi , oppo and honor .
comparable to 6t in many ways ; + and - across specifications and considering the price , i would rate this model better .
face lock is not good processing is also slow .
asus zenfone max pro m1 6 gb ram is gerat phone , gud working . nice looking
amazing.product in this price
the product is good .
too good to be described .
and even thanks to flipkart for early delivery .
good . but head phone is not there .
does not support video call
charging takes hell lot of time .
camera is also not up to the mark .
rest features are good
camera not good , tower problem , fingerprint and face lock not working properly

phone is nice package but camera is not so good
even though it has 6gb ram , it hangs up very often .
apps open up automatically .

using from past three months .
all features are good .
please let me know compatible wired earphones for this handset
excellent camera photos ( but you need to integrate google camera app )
fast charging no issue at all
just need stock camera upgradation
i took this mobile 2 months back .
hope this review will help you .

- screen touch is ok .
this phone is awesome
simply amazing mobile , thank u filp cart .
till now satisfied but battery is noot good ( looks like 3000mah battery ) . system itself drains battery fast. asus should provide update to solve this problem. camera is perfect. no heating. no lagging
flipkart is a cheater company. dont buy anything from here
just awesome in this budget
just loved its camera
performance is good but its fingerprint is not at all good and is made from old technology .
face unlock is better .
i am not saying camera is bad , u just need to spend time with the settings to get the optimum effect .
great phone must buy
pubg runs smoothly on this phone .
battery need to be improved otherwise everything is ok
but the camera quality is extremely bad .
but also want back cover with phone
mobile is good but google pai update version not available for this. if any one expected google latest update please don &apos;t go. remaining part it &apos;s good .
nice mobil value for money
they exclusively launch their phone on website , hence if you did not like the device because of features or user interface then you can not return it .
how will you be able to check the device before buying if it is not available in the retail shops . ?
you must accept returns .
excellent value for money product .
been using it now for almost 3 months .
great battery and performance .
awesome product for this price range .
all features superb nd 6gb ram is osm mobile. u all buy this product any causes .
when it bought flipkart the back panel cames with dent and they told me to it was because of shipping and replacement can &apos;t be done .
the product i received on 16th of october have so many problems .
for example screen hangs automatically , then no sensors works .
earphone and mic does not work properly .
product is 100 % must buy , but only disappointment i got is camera doesn &apos;t have panaroma feature .
how come you guys didn &apos;t gave this feature in max pro m1 model while same feature is available in basic model of all asus phone which stands in range of 7000-8000 rs .
kindly make some changes and provide update for the same for zenfone max1 pro .
the phone is smooth and fast .
very good for daily use .
i get two days battery backup .
everything is okay except the mediocre camera performance
some times it is hanging for 30 seconds while using small apps. i don &apos;t know why .
three finger screenshot is not in this phone .
old type of screenshot using volume button only present .
rearranging app menu to our favourite list in menu is not in this mobile .
hiding our secret app is not in this mobile .
these are the basic drawbacks in this phone .
this phone is very good .
i have been using it for more than 4 months .
smooth working , good images and most importantly for me is battery life for 1-2 days .
good mobile in this range .
the mobile is blazing fast !
join also working great
camera not up to mark as compare to honour and mi mobile in same price .
it has been dead in five months only and i have to go to asus service center .
exlent phone and build quality is awesome but camera is worrest and battery backup is exlent
as budget its nice phone .
suggest me any solution. please
tell me how to return or get use of warranty .
it &apos;s 2 month old brought on 5th november 2018
very good in bugdet
call recording , screen shot shortcut , screen tap to on screen , many good features of asus zenfone max not included in this phone ram 6gb not effective
phone is good. after few months of usage. the screen feels little rough. it has froze twice in these 2 months and found 10 people envying over it. so i &apos;m happy .
battery is awesome.over all performance is excellent.camera lover can take other brand .
it &apos;s a nice phone if you &apos;re looking for a gaming and high performance device , body is not beautiful but you can sacrifice the look for the other advantages like ram , processor n battery .
worst phone i have ever used
net speed so very good
overall phone is good but it got less android features.it got no adiitional camera setttings.no other video modes
lovely one satisfied with the product .
6gb of ram just at this price awesome .
the os is already using 30 gb out of 64 gb provided .
but if you like this product then this thing can be ignored but you will not get other product with these features at this amount. so go ahead .
bt quality of camera is avgerage .
overall it is a good set
it is one of the great budget smartphone under 15000 rupees .
i already have black variant and i recommended my father to buy grey variant .
it is a stock android , and has sd 636 processor with 6gb of ram , 16mp front and 16mp + 5mp rear camera and 5000 mah battery makes this smartphone one of the great featured and value for money .
very nice and smooth performance .this handsut is a good quality product .
my charger is not working .
i purchased the product 2 months back
superrrrb mobile according to price
u will face several issues
nice at this range
speed battery screen everything is fine .
the stock camera app is really bad .
and also had a bad experience purchasing it from flipkart
it &apos;s an average mobile to use
battery is 5000 mah but it will not last a long
performance of mobile is not that much great even it has 6gb ram
awesome , value for money
the product i am using is more than expected .
deliver was on time as mentioned while placing order .
very good phone at reasonable price .
you can go for it .
but either selfie or rear camera don &apos;t give attractive pictures .
only issue is slightly about camera.otherwise this device built wise , dedicated memory card slot , sound , display , battery back up excellent .
the software experience and the battery is the usp of this phone and it delivers .
it also has all the necessary sensors that need to be on a regular phone , barring nfc .
awesome phone with reasonable price .
especially battery performance best.but not having head phones
but features are not good as there is no gallery and sreen is also not good but battry life is just out standing
intenet speed slow comparison other simple android mobile
nice and working good as of now , everything is working good and no issues with the phone , best product and best performance
camera and display need so many improvements
product is good but as always flipkart goof it up paid for black color and recived blue color one
i am using from last 3 month its awesome phone .camera and battery is wow .
i was abt to purchase mi but i took a call to go with asus .
ui is better then mi .
i will suggest to choose this phone compare to mi
this is wonderful product after the nexes , google , oneplus and moto .
min price with good performance .
sound , mike , camera overall good
