i really love the camera , though i would have loved a telephoto lens .
the super steady ois works like a charm .
i have been using mi a1 with android one platform before , i find it a bit hard to find the settings options in s10 lite and mostly resort to google search figure out the settings .
the phone is fast .
great display .
the included case won &apos;t keep the dust-out and will require regular cleaning or will damage the phone &apos;s outer layer .
the fingerprint scanner is small and not so accurate .
awesome phone
samsung unveils a awesome s series in unbelievable price .
pro grade camera
awesome super amoled display with punch hole camera
super fast charging
gb ram for enough for gaming
no 3.5 mm headphone jack
single speaker
bought on first day sale .
updated review after the first software update after 1month usage .
the main negative thing that i was facing for the first month usage was in display fingerprint lock .
it was not as fast and accurate as a flagship level .
but after the first software update there is a slight improvement in the fingerprint lock as compared to before .
i hope that samsung can improve more in this on next updates .
its very light weight even though the battery is 4500mah .
you will get a p .

hi all ,
this is prasad and this is my full review regarding samsung galaxy s10lite after using it for say 9 days now .
1.lets talk about the build quality : i rate it 4.5 out of 5
nice tall phone with 6.7 &quot; fhd + super amoled display yeah its a 60hz display with 16m color depth makes the viewing experience on phone excellent .
combination of glass and plastic named glastic at the back does not feel cheap at all .
gives you a premium using experience .
rounded corners make griping the phone very w .
7 days review of the beast :
point by point review of each features for closest competitor of oneplus , samsung galaxy s10 lite :
on power use , it lasts for 1 and a half day .
on basic usage , lasts for two days .
on ultra power saving mode , 4 + days .
charges in one and a half hour .
contrast is 5 on 5 and colors are bright .
only refresh rate is a bit low .
3 . processing and switching : flawless switching of the applications .
no lag any time .
super fast call co .
worth buying .
i was confused between oneplus 7t and this phone .
finally , i went ahead with s10 lite and i &apos;m really happy with my choice .
i have been using this phone for like 10 days now .
the things i was looking for : good camera , good display , excellent processor and battery that keeps me up for a day at least .
i went on a trip immediately after receiving this device .
my reviews :
captures details very perfectly .
loved it .
you &apos;ll feel the flagship camera here .
samsung galaxy s10 lite is definitely worth the hype , heavy in specifications yet light in price .
i have been using this device for almost 12 days and here is my full fledged review of the device along with the pros and cons :
the moment you hold the device , only one word strikes your mind and that premium .
the phone offers 2020 flagship design with sd 855 chipset making it a beast when it comes to performance along with a great display with equally great viewing angles .
i purchased this product during its presale .
i was purchasing a new device for personal use after 2.5 years , the smartphone world had changed a lot since then .
but my close friend purchased oneplus 7t when it was launched .
so purchasing any comparable phone was a tough competition for me personally : ) read details below of my 2 weeks of experience of using this handset for nearly 12-14 hours daily , and also a head-on comparison with oneplus 7t .
also , i had watched every video on youtube about .
one of best device in the industry from the house of samsung .
awesome display , awesome camera , awesome body , awesome qualcomm processor , awesome battery , awesome design and unique color .
and not a chinese brand device .
i just bought the prism black variant .
the phone is really very good .
the things that i liked the most-
the color contrast is really nice .
2 . battery backup- the 4500 mah battery is very powerful and providing a good backup .
3 . performance- the phone is very fast .
all the gestures are swift and phone does not lag at all .
4 . fast charging- the phone gets fully charged within 1 hour .
5 . camera- both the front and rear cameras are bri .
everything is just flawless from camera to processor to design to battery everything is just awesome .
this is my first flagship phone .
and guys , trust me , it &apos;s too premium to hold in hand despite it &apos;s glastic back .
really a great competitor for oneplus 7t , i &apos;m happy that i got something different than the too common flagship like oneplus .
one of the best phone ever at this price .
verry smooth to use well battery backup and fantastic display and design .
just loved it
a powerful phone with stunning looks .
you can &apos;t go wrong with this buy .
after samsung note 3 in 2013 , i never bought samsung again but this phone launch compelled me to buy a samsung again ( but still i won &apos;t use it as this is for my wife ) .
anyways coming back to the phone , it is a must buy for anyone who plans to switch to high end phone but is sceptical .
i assure you that after using this you will never go back to any lower category .
samsung is going to be the king again if they keep .
great mobile .
with great features and great processor .
with super display and insane camera .
when i hold it in my hand .
it feels like iam holding a prism in my hand .
they only cut cost on things that are not important to me .
stereo speaker
apart from that .
the phone is not lite in any matter
update : could have worked on the sound output through bluetooth .
i am using samsung buds but not getting that much quality
do not opt to sell your old phone with flipkart .
they cheat you while pickup if your phone qualify all criteria than also they will not pick up or reduce the value of phone .
please do not exchange your phone on flipkart they fool you .
and there delivery people what they call them wish master are big cheaters as well
after 2 months of use !
i don &apos;t see the necessity of buying a 70k phone when this masterpiece can do anything that phones in the higer budget range can do .
pros
1 . great camera .
5 . great battery and fast charging
cons
2 . battery performance reduced what it used to be 2 months ago .
3 . fast charging capacity reduced eventually what .
after 5days of usage , here is my review .
1 ) display is crisp and awesome .
its huge , but still feels comfy in your hand &amp; amp ; easy for one hand use also .
2 ) camera is really a pro grade camera .
superb steady video .
you instantly become a fan of its camera .
3 ) battery lasts really long , for an avg user it easily lasts for a day &amp; amp ; half , plus it has a 25w charger , charges in under an hour from 0-95 % .
4 ) looks are pretty amazing .
phone feels light &amp; amp ; com .
its really great product from samsung and it is giving really a tough competition to one plus 7t and mid range phones.battery life , camera and video quality and stability ( thanks to super steady ois ) are pretty good .
also a big advantage is that samsung uses snapdragon 855 and one ui2 in this phone .
i am really enjoying this and experience is awesome .
it gives me a premium feel to hold it .
i got the phone on 18th march .
after usage of one month my experience is as follows : -
things those are great : -
1 . display , one of the best available in the market .
flat but almost baseless .
samsung displays are class apart .
2 . despite having 4500 mah battery , phone is light .
due to 20 : 9 aspect ratio grip is excellent and one handed usage isn &apos;t difficult .
3 . snapdragon 855 soc and one ui 2.0 makes a killer combination in terms of performance .
ui is feature rich without any lag .
it ’ s good product .
screen quality is good .
camera is working fine but not as expected .
battery is great with fast charger .
charger is with of both side c-type .
i always prefer samsung brand , so i love this phone .
also recommended to buy other .
if you are more interested in new features then this product have perfect solution for you .
this mobile have every thing which iphone does have but in camera it &apos;s okey ok but better than other samsung mobile .
i trusted this brand bcuz from childhood i used samsung only till date whatever i used according to that its lots more improvement product .
display -5 / 5
battery -5 / 5
my main requirments were camera , performance and battery life and i &apos;m very pleased on all the three .
my other choice was one plus 7t but camera wise samsung s10 lite is far better
awesome phone by samsung .
value for money
nice camera
awesome performance .
great battery with great fast charger
nice view angles thanks to display
type c earphones provided in the box nice to see that
great job done by samsung
best budget flagship phone .
samsung have finally managed to tick all right things at a very competitive pricing .
performance is par with premium phones .
one ui 2.0 is such a big improvement over older os .
charging is super fast .
yet to check camera performance .
motion photos are cool too .
its really awesome .
its stunning diaplay is even better tha youtube reviews .
samsung is the only brand which can compete with apple so far look is concerned .
samsung premium phone at this price is truely an amazing thing .
battery charged from 50 to 100 in half an hour
camera quality is too good
super study ois is awesome
lives up to expectations .
this is my first samsung android phone .
i was looking for budget flagship from samsung , saw this with great offers and immediately pre-ordered trusting samsung as a brand .
i was thinking to consider oneplus 7t for few months but somehow could not trust it .
sd855 does its job , its fast .
no need to turn on screen to .
nice .
very nice phone
changed the mindset about samsung phones .
must buy guys .
best phone from samsung at this budget .
only disappointment is exchanging phone , as they say one amount and when the guy comes to collect phone says due to small scratches we need to pay 1500 extra .
wonderful phone with best battery optimisation
screen quality is really very good .
camera options are best in class live focus video and zoom in mic .
one ui is also great to use .
better than one plus in certain aspects .
awesome phone thanks to samsung and flipkart
good mobile at this price range .
battery back up amazing .
snapdragon 855 with 8gb ram makes the phone superfast , no lagging at all .
sterio speakers absent but sound quality good .
some features in high end mobile removed to make it lite version like wireless charging , ip protection , curved screen , backside glass .
i have been using this phone for 5 weeks now .
pros
display 5 / 5
bright , crisp images .
battery 5 / 5
lasts 2 days on normal use and about 8 hours of continuous use .
charging 5 / 5
super fast charging rocks .
40 % charge in 16 minutes .
front camera 5 / 5
clear crisp picks .
good quality videos .
switching between wide angle and regular mode is crisp and useful .
smile at the cam and it clicks on its own .
back camera 5 / 5
really good quality pics and videos .
wide angle .
bought this phone for 30000 inr after exchange offer and icici credit card discount .
i feel 30000 is the right money for this device .
this is my first samsung phone that runs android , because i am not a fan of samsung .
i narrowed down my ch .
i had used oneplus for almost 4 years .
oneplus was not innovating things and felt they have slowed down a bit .
i always loved the display on a samsung phone .
but , this time they released an all rounder which has amazing performance , battery and camera .
really happy with this buy
mobile seem to be good in initial impression , but , flipkart &apos;s biggest joke of the year is &quot; exchange offer &quot; , they expect new condition mobile should be exchanged for getting new mobile .
it &apos;s not possible for most of the people .
big disappointment !
awesome phone with excellent display and performance .
dream fulfilled with snapdragon processor in samsung phone .
yes samsung one ui with snapdragon 855 is solid smooth .
perfect design to compete in mid range segment .
only cons are no glass body and no wireless charging support .
overall good performance and good camera .
super steady ois added advantage to camera .
one of the best phone in this price range .
i am writing this review after using 10 days of this phone .
i would like to tell u that this is the phone which i am waiting since long in this price range .
100 % satisfied with its performance &amp; amp ; price .
i bought that mobile in 27856 / - .
got the best deal .
good camera performance , battery back is also very good .
video quality is also nice .
but only thing that not getting original flip cover &amp; amp ; other accessories in the market due to china s problem .
great phone at this price .
i upgraded from galaxy s8 and am surprised by how much better this phone is .
1 . screen quality is excellent .
no 90hz display but great colours and viewing angles which matter more .
2 . battery life is amazing , you can get 1.5 days which is rare in flagships .
3 . performance is fast , no hiccups noticed .
4 . camera is good , i don &apos;t use it much so cant comment .
5 . samsung pay is really important these days , i haven &apos;t carried my wallet since the time i have been usin .
excellent phone .
one of the best affordable flagship phone for those who are in budget considering their exchange and card offers .
being one plus user for past 4 years and switching to samsung was little sceptical but then enjoying all the features of the phone .
thank you samsung for a wonderful experience .
there is no doubt about samsung .
it is a valve for money .
excellent camera along with vibrant display and powerful processor makes it a perfect smartphone .
camera : camera is really very good .

initial impressions …
i am on my second unit because the first one had an unevenly lit display at low brightness .
current unit also has the same issue but it ’ s not as bad as the first one .
i just keep adaptive brightness disabled and manually manage it to get around this issue .
annoying but manageable .
i am kind of ok with oneui software .
it has a bunch of features that i like .
coming from pixel 2 , it took a while to get used to the interface , but it has been largely ok .

finally a samsung flagship phone launched in india with top of the line snapdragon 855 processor .
absolutely loved my purchase , below are some of my thoughts on various aspects of the phone .
build - premium build quality with metallic frame and the unique glasstic ( glass + plastic ) back .
it offers scratch resistance like glass , and shatter-resistance and light weight like plastic .
prism white color looks elegant , with a rainbow hue when light reflects off it .
the metallic frame also gives a pr .
good samsung product in this price range .
screen and display is amazing with super amoled display .
overall good performance from the phone for daily use .
two things i didn &apos;t enjoying like other people are also saying , the on screen fingerprint scanner is slow and buggy .
it takes time to recognize and also it failed to recognize fingerprint .
also i faced issue with the samsung pay , i did the setup as mentioned in the app but when i tried to pay in a store using nfc it failed the transaction m .
if your budget is 35-40 k , go for this device eyes closed .
also got bumped up discount if 3000 extra on exchange and more 3000 off on icici bank credit card .
its a very sweet deal from flipkart .
device is little big compared to other flagship mobiles .
but if you love big screen you &apos;ll love this device .
after my wonderful 2.5 years with samsung note 8 , i hv decided to upgradeyou may think s10 lite might not be the upgrade for note 8 , but i didnt want to spend 70k on note 10 or s10 .
as much as i love s pen , note 10 lite is not as good as s10 lite in my opinion .
after researching and comparing many phones , considering all the facts i chose s10 lite ( closest 2nd option was 7t and 7 pro ) .
i received my phone ( blue ) on 6th feb.
following are my evaluation after 9 days of use .
1 . value for .
below is my detailed genuine review on each segment after 2 weeks of usage
it shoots great photos in good light ( both front and back ) and when tried in in-indoors with medium / low light , clarity is not up to mark .
samsung needs to really work on camera with low / medium light .
if camera is your main priority then go for one plus 7t .
battery : excellent .
charges in 1 hr and lasts upto .
most awesome phone samsung could ever make .
battery is superb .
last more more than 2 days on decent use .
camera is also decent .
since i have to take lot of pics of texts , the image quality was not so good .
macro shots will be better .
screen is superb .
speaker not so loud .
but performance is awesome .
never it has crashed even once .
would recommend to everyone
samsung lover .
superb phone everything is greatly compiled by samsung in thus new samsung s10lite .
no words to explain my happiness for s10lite
nice flagship phone in midrange
bought samsung phone after a very long time .
seems better now .
have been using since last 10 days and have no complaints .
first come to its screen , the samoled display looks great the colors are good , you can &apos;t expect less from samoled .
secondly the camera setup is amazing , loved the macro shots and overall camera quality is amazing .
the battery is doing really well and above expectations , with gaming , and all day connected to wifi , bluetooth , calls it goes for more than a day .
and obviously it has fast charger so g .
this review is given on the basis of 1 week use of s10 lite .
it could have been better , not upto the mark because of f / 2.0 aperture and also due to the absence of depth sensor .
the supersteady mode is really awesome and night mode is really great captures sharp images.you can also record 4k videos with super steady ois
build quality :
super big screen size with super amoled display ( 6.7 &apos; ) and it is a full hd one .
back is glastic not the normal glass but it is not that bad st .
the phone is definitely a true blue blood samsung and brings back the memories of an affordable phone with great features .
it outshines the one plus somewhere and brings itself back in business !
superb phone , nothing like anything , everything is perfect .
many problems solved .
love it .
phone is super cool .
samsung has launched excellent phone in this category with latest update and features .
phone is good as per the price range ,
but being 4500 mah battery , the backup is poor , rest all is good .
my oneplus 7 gives screen on time of 6hrs and has way less battery than this .
this phone is giving me 4.5 hrs of screen on time ,
that to only when i use fb , netflix and whatsapp ( no games ) .
my recommendation is to go for the oneplus 7t for better screen refresh rate , ufs 3.0 etc .
thanks to flipkart for 2 day delivery .
batttery easily going for 1.5 to 2days with daily usage , as am not a game lover or pubg lover but i could feel the perfomance and handling quality .
phone is too lite which will feel easy in your hand .
only the fingerprints scanner is a bit slow performing which might rectify in coming software upgrade i hope .
overall i will give 4.5 out of 5 .
loved the phone .
fingerprint is taking time to unlock phone .
just for seeing purpose looks good .
but battery life is not that much good .
cam is not that much good .
i was really disappointed after buying this .
please improve battery life and fingerprint sensor .
ultimate beast
i &apos;m using samsung phones from last 15yaers n i want &apos;s to appreciate samsung for their day to day improvements
picture quality , features , battery , super fast charger and performance are just outstanding
side edge feature is superb which give you most of control from home screen
i give 10 out of 5
anyone if thinking to buy just go onn .
highly recommended .
today got completed 3 month of using this phone .
till now i am loving this phone .
earphone is not at all good as it is not working and i am not able to replace it due to lockdown .
hope so it get replaced soon .
fingerprint sensor is real headache .
that will not work smooth .
disappointed with security feature .
what a worst phone .
i have pre-booked the phone and given away one plus 5 .
i use phones a lot .
i have used one plus 5 for 2.5 years and never got stuck .
this phone got stuck the second day .
after almost 20 days of usage .
i say it is one waste phn from samsung .
camera : enhances the images , no reality , if you zoom a picture , the picture will look like an oil painting .
battery : ok , comes one day .
display : is bright .
back camera : which material in specific has been used for protection of back camera lenses as the whole module protrudes out a bit ? please answer .
average display panel .colours though are vivid compared to ips lcd .
pretty average !
audio : average .
form factor and weight balance : stays intact in palm with case &amp; amp ; well balan .
best deal at the best price .
overall good phone .
very fast in almost every task but nothing special to write .
video quality is good , sound is just ok . fast charging behaves surprisingly sometimes it will charge in an hour and sometimes it will take more than 2 hours to charge in full .
good but can be better in terms of premium features
camera is not upto the mark required better low light images
finger prints scanner not working some time
wifi connectivity is worse my old s7 has better connectivity
ip rating should be there
writing after 2 weeks of use .
good cameras , decent battery , great processor capabilities , dropping 3.5mm audio is a royal pain when there are no good alternatives in market , screen goes unresponsive sometimes for few seconds ( could be slower fs ) , unremovable bloatware present , oneui is not impressive .
not mindblowing for 40k , 1 + 7pro seems better option right now in this price range .
best handset ever .
looks better than all s series .
have a note 10 plus too but somehow felt s10 lite seems better in performance and battery .
qualcomm is the kind of processors .
is high time samsung realizes this and promotes qualcomm more than its exynos once .
overall superb built with a superior camera and better multi tasking options .
loved it to the core .
i have used 10 days full on .
after that i write all the thing &apos;s in this phone is awesome except signal quality ( signal reception ) network in indoors area .
if you want too use your 3.5mm earphone then you have to purchase the 3.5 mm samsung dongle ( 3.5 mm to c type converter ) anyother dongle is not supported
s10 lite is a powerful flagship machine with a qualcomm 855 processor which fits in the budget of many and is value for your money .
2 . awesome camera quality with super steady ois support which performs exceptionally well .
3 . super amoled display is a pleasure for your eyes .
4 . powerful 4500mah battery with super fast charging .
takes 1 hr to charge from 10 to 100 .
5 . full samsung pay support .
cons : nothing so far .
i am a fan of samsung one ui and samsung pay .
so i was waiting for a good samsung phone since few months .
when samsung announces s10 lite , i searched it on many websites , i seen many reviews on youtube , comparision with one plus 7t .
finally i decided to prebook it .
i got it in 31000 rs .
i am using this device since last one week .
as on day my reviews is as under .
1 . camera : quality is just of flagship level .
camera is superb in all conditions as day , low light etc .
nice phone .
i purchased it for 28000 .
its a no brainer , just go for it .
i did lot of research on internet to figure out if i should go with smasung s10 lite or one plus 7t .
i went ahead with samsung as a brand .
trust me guys its worth every penny .
if you are in a budget and want a flagship mobile , this is the one to go .
those doesn &apos;t matter for daily usage and the display and camera of this mobile is so awesome .
the battery life is a major plus of this mobile , easily lasts the entire day .
display , camera , built quality and speed is excellent .
good product .
samsung released this one with snapdragon 855 ( the best thing they did till date )
don &apos;t know why they called it lite version - they should have named it entirely different than s10 lite .
performance : sd855 chip is working like a charm , no issue in heating while gaming and it is smooth .
build : th .
great phone
display could had been sharper with more ppi
best thing is samsung with snapdragon in india
switching to s20 series only for camera upgrade .
awesome camera , display and battery performance .
after using it for one week my review is as under :
camera : 5 / 5
software : 5 / 5
it is a beast made by samsung one must not miss it .

first time samsung bring budget flagship mobile .
processors and one ui both are doing phenomenal jobs here .
camera is just par with s series legacy .
battery is awesome this time compared to flagship s series .

this mobile was gifted to my cousins fiance and this is her review
2020 valentine came with a bug surprise from my hubby .
i have been gifted samsung s 10 lite , the newly launched mobile phone in india .
totally awestruck by this phone and its features.handsdown one of the best android phone launched in the market by samsung company worth the price it is valued at .
starting from the cover which looks as classy as it could be , when you unbox the phone and start using it , you will be amazed by a .
all of a sudden , started troubling c type ear phones , intermittent connectivity problem .
this is really not expected from samsung .
unable to find the reason of failure as c type ear phones are just started in market .
very delicate ear phones .
overall performance is satisfactory !
i am using the samsung s10 lite mobile phone for 10 days and i am really satisfied with my expectations from it .
following is the list of the things which i really liked and i would strongly recommend others also to go for this phone .
mainly they sell phones with snapdragon processor only in the usa )
2 ) best camera setup with osi ( optical image stabilization works very well for all types of photos and .
i suppose it &apos;s the first top end budget from samsung side .
pleasure to use it .
good processor , good weight distribution , good battery management , an awesome camera and affordable device .
thank you samsung and flipkart
just an amazing product from samsung .
i was waiting for it for like 5-6 months .
had multiple options .
after thinking between apple and samsung .
i decided to go with samsung brand .
on premium front it lacks behind .
its high end phone with premium specification .
it lacks ip certification and wireless charging .
built quality is top notch .
cant believe samsung will such product at 40k range .
to be honest , i will never go with apple .
this phone was .
there &apos;s no option for exchange or replacement .
phone is lagging already after few hours of usage .
display is not good .
earphones looks like cheap quality .
white colour varient looks like china mobile .
totally disappointed by flipkart .
i love this mobile when this mobile launched .
i am using this phone and performance is superb .
all apps was opening very fast .
snapdragon 855 processor working great .
full hd + super amoled plus screen is perfect for watching hd videos .
about its camera : wide angle and macro camera is also works and gives nice clicks .
i am playing the mafia city game and find this game opens rapidly and g .
i am really impressed with the phone considering the price .
around 35 40k this is the best phone i would say .
seamless touch .
its a very good phone .
however , the front camera aggressively softens every detail .
thankfully the device runs on snapdragon , so it was like a 5 mins job to install gcam on it so , that problem is solved .
samsung &apos;s software is really the best android skin i have ever used and love all the extra features and mainly the samsung pay which is really really good .
good lock is a very good software to have with thousands of possible customization options .
secure folder is a nice thing to have and t .
has a very good battery life .
camera is decent for the price .
unbelieveable that samsung released such a good mobile in this price range
i had pre booked the device and got the delivery on 5th feb as assured .
thank you flipkart for the quick delivery .
amazing value for money .
great performance , decent camera and superb battery .
what else could one ask at such a price !
feels like a steel
under the hood , the spec sheet is good and the real world performance matches the technical details .
pros
the main pros are the screen and the battery .
the screen is a super amoled and not a dynamic amoled one as the main s series .
though this is a super amoled plus screen and samsung being the masters in that department i don &apos;t see this as a bad display at all .
the infinity o display according to me is the best implementation of how a front cam should be on a screen .
it hardly gets in .
bought it after exchanging my old samsung a10 and also getting 3k instant discount using icici credit card .
i moved from a budget phone to this so called budget flagship .
thoroughly enjoying this mobile &apos;s performance , display , cameras , and battery life .
display is awesome with crisp , clear , and rich rendition .
all the four cameras doing incredibly good job .
