i was expecting better for gaming .
but its not good. i bought today but now im going to sell it as soon as possible .
i got 6gb version at nearly 11k in offer best value for money deal .
flipkart delivery was pathetic but the phone is awesome .
its is the best mobile phone in its category and price with the features that it has in it for the amount being paid .
instead of buying third grade chinese product like mi , oppo , vivo , huawai people can always buy this product and its value for money .
i bought this mobile on november 2. after three months mobile condition
finger print sensor is not working
fast charger not works. may be a update fix this
it takes 5 to 7 hours for full charging. some times fast charge works and it takes 2.30 hours
you can &apos;t use flash in mobiles while the object is near. it will show white screen .
i thinking want to change mobile in next three months
this is bad product .
in this mobile privacy not secure.and flipkart easy return policy is froud policy .
one new problem created phone not locked .
am getting trouble front camera
it &apos;s not working properly .
sometimes the device suddenly struck .
and i asked in helpline in online but they didn &apos;t say proper solutions to me .
finally i wasted money to buy this device .
flipkart doing it &apos;s not fair business , we are not fooles to purchase product on-line especially on flipkart. after expiring exchange / refund time u r sending sorry seller not excepted u r request , it &apos;s not fair .
not getting updates , update patch is of april , not getting proper battery backups .
worst mobile i have ever purchased .
the phone is good it &apos;s battery is awesome nice camera and it comes with a nice processor happy with this phone so far so good thanks flipkart for such a good service
the product is superb n thanks flipkart for its super fast delivery .
i got it in 2 days
it &apos;s an amazing phone
super mobile 6 gb ram 64 gb storage + dedicated slot + dual volte
awesome phone at this price .
some bugs are there but what the phone offers is more than you can can ask at this price .
the device is defective that send to me
do not buy this mobile .
i am just using this mobile for one week , but facing lot of problems .
do become a victim for this mobile .
no replacement from flipkart for software related issues .
the basic requirement of any mobile is communication .
this mobile has the problem even in that .
let me list the issues i see
1 ) my family members at times could not reach my mobile number , even though they try multiple time .
experiencing this issue after using this mobile .
display is very bad it &apos;s naturally damaged
many isaues such as flickering , multi touch issues .
camera is pathetic. they did great marketing by youtube videos but believe me it is worst camera .
screen quality is pathetic .
i purchased it after watching youtube tutorial about it &apos;s glass but it just breaks .
in 4 month of use my phone falls twice from 2 feet height and both time display broken .
i am fed up with this quality .
first of all let me talk about its design
metal body with rounded corners look is very good
durable also and a b + design
both cpu and gpu serves well with hd graphics for pubg
battery : - 5000 mah with 10hours plus sot with moderate usage and mild gaming
cameras : - worst 16 + 5 mp cameras but very worst in terms of performance portrait mode is also not automatic we need to adjust it manually that &apos;s a con
front camera is also not upto the mark
fantastic product from asus at competitive price in the market .
not show up net speed
not a smart key like screen shot and more
best buy till now .
performance is awesome. pricing is very much accessible .
most idiotic phone ever. absolute rubbish. hangs every time .
recently problem with screen it freezes and to open i have to restart the phone .
all my data contacts gone. cause hanging issue was so much that i had to factory reset the phone the problem still persists .
i am not a heavy gamer. hardly installed a few useful apps like flipkart. paytm uber. user interface and screen touch is very poor .
i want my money back from asus company .
finger print scanner is very bad .
display brokened in simple fall
extremely high end phone for professional .
bought three months ago , no hanging , not at all slow , camera one of the best rocking camera , no one can bet this phone ever in this price range .
it &apos;s a mother of all phones .
best ever 6gb phone phone , smooth performance , excellent performance , it &apos;s amazing .
go for this phone .
lot of bugs and software issues .
camera performance poor , no galley , no scanner , no call recording , no return and refund , battery performance much better , when we are using redmi phone we can &apos;t accept this one , sound problems also , some time no ring
mobile is nice , camera quality is average , battery is awesome , screen quality is good , but some times finger print is not working { lagaging } , giving review after 5 months. hope this review useful to all
i am very happy with it &apos;s very nice allrounder performance
at the time of writing , all is good .
is not good battery backup is nice but overall performance is very bad. dont buy it in this price
good for gaming and many purposes
they gave me trashy phone and didn &apos;t change my piece tell me to go to service centre .
why should i go to service center and why can &apos;t you give me a good piece ?
worst service ever total fraud .
it &apos;s hang many time even it has 6 gb ram .
this is my 2nd asus smartphone within 3 years .
prior to this , i have used asus zenfone 2 laser which is also functional presently .
gone are the days of that smartphone maker which says &quot; india ka smartphone &quot; .
now asus is the leader in this segment and above on the basis of my experience .
the phone is sturdy , macho and robust .
battery back-up is excellent .
the phone is packed with 5000mah battery which proves its prowess .
it has dual volte by which one can use two jio sims &apos; .
first of all thank you flipkart for fast delivery service .
camera is awsome specially in low light , sun light .
although auto focus is overall good too .
battery management could be better doesn &apos;t affect in normal use but drains a bit faster while playing heavy games like pubg .
processor sd636 works good , no heating issues found till now even pubg runs smoothly .
review after using 12 days .
not full size display in youtube .
but it is awesome
value for money 5
i love this mobile .
best gaming phone under 15k
waste product no one purchase that kind of mobiles in any asus product
best mobiles in rs 12999
when calling often hang .
some time hang some function .
all things are excellent except camera .
long battery life and 6gb ram is best pro for it .
only thing that i am not able to cast my phone .
there is some issue with screen mirroring .
please fix this issue to get more rating for the phone .
overall phone is working fine till now .
nice product thank you asus and nice delivery time to time
after using this product , i become die-hard fan of asus .
it &apos;s so amazing smartphone at so reasonable price .
loved everything of it .
actually , in fact , after buying it i become so addictive to it , spent hours .
ya , i know never to get addict to something but this is so marvelous .
keep it up asus !
thanks for coming in my life .
for this price its performance really awesome this is my first time comment after purchasing of several mobiles
best mobile it &apos;s really good
best and good performance and compare to all prices mobiles this is the best .
it mainly good on speed , gaming , accessibility , easy to access , better battery , good processor , . etc are best in this mobile so make chance to buy this one
best smartphone in the 15k segment .
# error !

for a smartphone in 15k range it stands quite good with other competitors .
i personally liked the smartphone very much .
nice ram management , i bought this product 12k , valu for mony
very bad camera clarity .
valuable product below 15000
surprisingly amazed by the quality and first class performance .
thanks to flipkart and asus for making such a good gadget affordable .
no complaints till date , i am a happy customer .
awesome mobile at this price .
one of its amazing feature which is not present in any mobile is it &apos;s connectivity with external hard disk .
it supports 1 tb hard disk just like laptop .
mobile is unable to connect to the wifi .
looks like its an defect piece .
best battery in this budget lasts almost two days
awesome camera both rear and selfie
camera app not much user friendly
best buy in this price range .
okayish camera quality , memory expandability and battery life !
i am using the phone since november .
its an excellent phone and suits all my requirements .
after using for 3 months
pros : the camera biggest plus is its battery .
way better than xiomi .
screen display and touch are good .
sound quality and build is good .
fits well in hand
cons : selfie camera is not that great .
camera app like b12 can be downloaded to take good custom selife .
gallery : no pre installed gallery .
no text editing options in pics .
again download any gallery app of your preference
call record and conference : call recording option not there .
after using of 6 month this mobile getting hanged and lots of application not working properly
not good as expected
best product in the budget smartphone segment .
camera with google camera it phenomenal
this phone is an all rounder from every aspect .
the 6gb variant blazes through every task throw at it .
the screen is decent and the viewing angles are good .
the only problems are ( i ) no screen protection ( ii ) the battery drain issue .
good phone in the range and awesome experience using it
good camera back and front .
con : 1.looks , 2.bettery performance 3 weight and old model 4.screen not gorilla glass 3
very happy with the performance of asus zenfone max pro m1 .
the battery performance , display quality , camera quality is amazing .
poor camera , decent ui .
good at the range .
with 6 gb ram
don &apos;t buy this mobile with complete mobile protection 1 year plan , jeeves and flipkart cheating the people .
i buy my mobile with complete mobile protection plan dated on 05-oct-18 rs.499 / - .
i lost my mobile dated on 10-dec-18 then i informed to jeeves now they are saying your mobile protection plan is only for damage protection not covered for theft .
when i buy my mobile they clearly mentioned complete mobile protection plan including theft .
while charging mobile and charger become heat .
no proper support with flipkart service
perfect phone for everyone those who want gaming and long battery backup
asus zenfone max pro m1 is one of the good budgeted phone for battery and performance .
i bought for my friend and he seems to be enjoying it .
i , would recommend to go ahead for 4-6 gb ram .
battery with 5000mah , will give you 2 days standby .
it &apos;s ultimately the buyers choice .
nice product no issue after usage of 1 month fully satisfied
i am editing the review because after receiving pie update from asus i feel like i have wasted money on this phone .
android pie provided by the asus is full of bugs and even there are features like digital wellbeing and the night light is missing .
system ui is very poor they have not worked on it even a bit .
now we can &apos;t play pubg in hd graphics after pie update .
go for other brands .
camera is not good
beware of network connectivity issues in this phone .
bettery is advantage of this mobile , no natch display in this asus zenfone max pro m1 and no gorrella glass protection in this mobile and eis ( electronic image stabilization ) is not there
battery is not good it is normal any take time like redmi phone which have only 4000 mah battery capacity
best mobile in this segment every thing is best off best
i faced it twice in just 1 month .
however , overall phone is good in this price .
the battery is a monster
display is very good
performance is also good
but the front camera need some improvement
the best in this price range .
my suggestion is no one can buy this asus zenfone max pro m1 because in exchange it only prices for around 3600 inr , very very bad exchange price , another cheating from asus is asus zenfone max pro m2
bad at network and updates
after 1 year of usage battery drain problem. charging port problem. volume buttons problem. don &apos;t go for it. horrible
not match with expectations. display quality not good. auto brightness function not proper
it &apos;s simply a beast
this is the best cellphone under 15000 in india .
very satisfied with performance .
camera is also fantastic .
asus - keep it up .
excellent phone with fully loaded features .
it &apos;s been a week now with asus zenfone max pro m1 .
superb battery life works entire day with continue watching whatsapp , calls and videos still more than 30 % remains at night .
processor is fast and nice 6gb and 64gb .
full marks should definitely go for it .
flipkart delivery is quick got faster then expected .
the phone is perfect one
asus best ever product
i ought it only for 11700
superb phone under 13999
best mid range fone .
really the best phone in this price range .
the stock android is very optimised and balanced .
the battery is the best of its kind and software-hardware integration is very fluent .
bhailog , i got 6gb version for 15 k three months back .
and no other phone comes in par with this one .
initially i hated this coz of the bugs .
later asus fixed almost all the bugs .
cannot recommend this to you now as by this time new phones must have arrived .
but i m loving this now .
only drawback was camera but trust me , u need to get used to the camera app .
learn how it performs and then when u know how to click it easily defeats redmi note 5 pro even in camera section .
flipkart delivery was fast .
ordered it for wife ’ s birthday .
she is just loving it .
although a bit heavier than her previous phone , this phone ’ s performance is amazing .
camera is way better than redmi note 5 pro .
i took similar pictures in rn5 pro and the picture looks quite fake in it .
battery is really great .
lasts for almost 2 days .
sound quality is superb .
speakers are too loud and good for playing music aloud .
front cam can be much better
camera need to be improve , battery backup is very good , ram management is very good .
battery backup is very good .
both cameras are good .
ram management also good .
asus should have to give inbuilt , gallery , network speed meter , ir blaster , auto call pickup , rocket cleaner .
it &apos;s a gem kind of phone at this price . no lag no heat . decent camera .
and battery is just love
phone is just ossam looks , feature &apos;s , resolution , size , camera , finger print scanner every thing works like charm .
in 15 k u don &apos;t even think twice just go for it and i bet u won &apos;t regret.i told every one that this is for 22 k and they actually believe
without a single ?
touch is not good .
touch does not work many times .
best phone. this is the value for money
simply the best phone you could buy below 15k budget .
and the good news is that , now the price has dropped even more .
i have downloaded google camera what a pic i love asus i m waiting asus rog
camera is too low
it &apos;s a very nice phone .
i love this phone very much .
a bit more optimistic , but this phone has the potentials of having good fight with xiaomi products for the market share in terms of their sales volume
good phone @ less price
front camera not that good , camera flash on / off botton so annoying .
but battery , phone speaker and processing are awesome .
if you are looking for a camera phone , i suggest you go for other .
but if you are a game lover , this phone is the best .
who is the best device i have witnessed in my whole life .
anyone can use it and it is the best device under 15000 rupees
phone performance is good but not getting any update of android pie .
there 2 big issue with phone
1 ) display show &apos;s yellow tint basically it can &apos;t produce exact white color .
2 ) auto brightness sensor doesn &apos;t work .
best feature of phone are
1 ) huge battery life
2 ) fantastic face unlock
good phone but need to update .
after replacement camera work very well .
the camera user interface is very bad .
performance as well as battery is the best in this price range .
no manual mode and panorama in camera .
the camera hardware is good , the software has to be updated very much , default snapdragon camera app does not do justice .
great value for money .
didn &apos;t face any issues.we get a clear case in the box , recommended to get a tempered glass since it doesn &apos;t have a gorilla glass .
after software update in november 2018 , the touch is not working .
not able to use the phone , looking for the solution
altogether a great phone , but the camera sometimes struggles with focusing .
gallery option is not available as like other there only file manager .
songs player is not available goole play music only .
don &apos;t think twice. just take it. only the notch is missing. otherwise the best mobile for the price. mind boggling battery life. spectacular display. nd amazing camera .
got it for a net price of 11700 .
i m writing this review after 15 days of purchasing , the phone is good till now .
camera is awesome , both front and back .
the sensitivity of the touch screen is not that good , sometimes u hv to tap or press on the screen vry hard .
other than this the phone is very good , i liked it .
i got it for 11,689. it &apos;s good price for 6gb ram .
screen touch very low quality
if you want to play pubg in hd graphics with low prize. this asus zenfone max pro m1 6gb ram is best option. it &apos;s my opinion .
i &apos;ve been using it for one week .
. i am giving 5 star to everything because it is my first android phone . , .and i haven &apos;t seen this type of performance .
the package was delivered one day early !
with 6gb your phone runs smoothly !
the touch screen is nice .
the fingerprint works great !
latest update gives 4k video recording .
i am happy with asus .
purchased in big billion days for 11700 / - .
great value for money product
1. near stock android with super smooth ui and shine added features like gesture controls
2. battery backup , best in class approx 9 to 10 hrs screen on time plus 1 day standby with single sim 4g , and data always on .
that means if you use your phone for about 4 to 4.5 hrs a day you can expect it to last 2 days .
3. decent cameras , xiami and realme have better cameras for sure but this one also has good cameras
other than camera and display everything is good .
i played pubg continuesly for 6hrs from 100 to 10 %
very good phone , value for money , my brother have redmi note 5 pro , in most aspects it &apos;s better than note 5 pro even pubg runs buttery smooth and better on this phone than redmi note 5 pro. highly recommend
it is one of best smartphones under 15k .
battery life is so good and body designs are very beautiful
one thing that lack is theme option is not there you need other software for theme .
overall it is really king budget phone
awesome phone just loved it
excellent phone at such a price .
excellent display best for videos watching .
excellent for gaming and social networking app .
only thing is no manual mode in camera .
excellent phone in this price segment .
only two problem with this phone no inbuilt call regarding and screenshot .
the camera performance at low light / night is poor. the rest all things in the phone are the best in class .
touch response. can &apos;t detect fast light touches , my zenfone 3 is more responsive .
zen ui is better with pixelmaster .
previous pics not optimized for wallpaper , getting stretched .
cameras could have had sony imx sensors like redmi note 5 pro
speaker problem . cant enable lte. battery drain 4 hours scren on time
everything is ok , display required full screen
after lot of research i find this was the best mobile among all low budget smartphones with 6gb of ram and 64 gb of internal memory with 5000 mh battery with fast charge 10 w .
which can screencast also with smart tv .
and it have 16 + 5 and 16 mp selfie camera with led flash .
camera is not that clean i don &apos;t know what is the real megapixels of these cameras but i am big gamer and i need good processor with good battery and big ram with 6gb .
camera quality not so good but over all in it price i had brought 11,700 is quit good .
mobile phone is very nice but charger poor quality
they can improve fingerprint and face unlock .
apart from that , phone is grate
camera quality is too good better than 3 / 4 gb varrient .
battery back awesome and too fast finger print .
but face unlock is slow .
after all good product .
i &apos;m very happy with this product .
mostly features are missing
1. install google cam app and this phone will rock .
this phone produces best and actual natural colors in pic .
no beautification without asking .
do not update this phone to android pie ( system updates ) .
ur phone will rock on oreo only .
3.i tried low , average and heavy use : in all condition battery crossed 36 hrs benchmark ( all time 4 g on )
4. no screen protector : (
5. phone is much sleeker than other 5000 mah battery competition
excellent phone . battery , camera , perfomance , display etc .
the best , just go for it
review in short words .
product is awesom , superb , best in class , worth it .
flipkart is highly recommended , must buy only from flipkart .
good camera , gaming speed is fabulous , battery performence is superb over all the best mobile in this price list
product is too good , awesome. i dont have word to explain .
and performance is amazing , the 6 gb ram will flaw like a water , no lag at all , battery is awesome iam an hardcore gamer usually spent time on pubg , and batteryback up i got was outstanding , and u can play pubg in hd , and high
good phone at this price or speed was soo good
earlier i had given it 5 star rating but now after new update , the experience is very horrible .
1 ) 5000 mah battery is reducing like 2500 mah
2 ) bass is completely distorted , horrible sound experience
3 ) night light feature is missing
best phone at the best price
- 16 mp front cam and 16 + 5 mp dual rear cam is more than awesome
- 6 gb ram with snapdragon 636 processor is working very smoothly
nice phone with normal price good screen resolution
kudos. most valuable for money .
i bought it in big billion day after a long research for good all-round performing mobile .
guys this is the one which ticks all the boxes .
wat else u want .
can play pubg with high graphics in he and pubg promises updates for her graphics .
better than redmi note 5 pro which runs medium graphics .
grey variant is very classy and it &apos;s a battery beast
worst performance software problem device hangs
5000mah battery but no use .in idle condition also battery dry please asus solve this issue
asus zenfone max pro m1 is an outstanding next gen premium handset with excellent features. fast for it &apos;s 6gb ram .
5k + battery weighs a bit but it has a sturdy nice balanced grip. grey is somewhat goldish-grey and does stand out .
made by and for quality demanding perfectionists . ( need no stars for this honest review .
asus maxpro m1 good battery back up , stock android experince , smooth performance but camera was not good in low light condition .
biggest problem is that it has no native vedio calling option for jio users .
will have to use other apps for vedio calling .
and earphone is not provided with the phone .
rest all is a good phone .
it is an awesome product of asus .
from my opinion , most of the middle class customers are looking for a phone like this .
better performance with zero hanging , long time battery life , best image quality , value for money etc .
the processor is also quite good .
again and again i am expecting the products like this .
best at this price .
good product value for money
finger and face unlock work well 6gb ram give great experience
great image quality , lovely looking , awesome feature , value for money
power performance when you playing high level game like pubg awesome
very very nice this product please all the time buying .
nice phone with amazing price
it &apos;s a very facinating device for me , overall satisfied performance .
bed mobile don &apos;t waste money
best product in this price segment
using this product without any lag. trusted brand asus . just go for it without any hesitation. thanx flipkart
my experience good product
battery awesome camera in low light is very bad must be improve
on time delivery nice mobile value for money
must buy product at all .
if you wanna best phone under 15k , then you are highly recommended to buy this phone .
this phone compete with major product of range up to 25k .
some are asking about the durability .
don &apos;t worry about this aspects because i &apos;m using this phone since 3 month but it never got under any type of repairs .
battery backup is awesome and it gives me two days of reliablity .
display and sound quality are also good .
1.superb for pubg asphalt etc no lag excellent performance .
2.very little heating even after playing pubg for more than 1hr .
3.camera at its best with google camera hdr + support .
4.value for money with these amazing specifications
6gb 64gb variant 636 sd etc face lock fingerprint lock etc
5.face unlock works even at 10 to 20degree was surprised to see this and both face fingerprint sensors work fastly. satisfied with this .
best phone but camera litil down
very nice and very very very good i like it this mobile
nice battery backup , superb performance .
network connectivity problem because of that can &apos;t even play pubg .
camera is still need to be improved .
every device has its own pros and cons .
however this device is awsome and has plenty of positive aspects .
but again it also has few but very important drawbacks .
amongst which i would like to mention , no vibrate or silent mode shortcut key , which is a very important feature missing .
no proper profile management options / shortcuts .
pathetic and very very pathetic battery performance .
needs 2-3times of full charge if i put 2 number of 4g sim cards .
and run continuous wi-fi .
i bought it at rs11700 so no complaint as it no other brand provide with similar configuration .
don &apos;t bought 3or 4 gb ram version only go for 6gb ram version as i already used 4gb version too
camera is improved no doubt about it .
no heat while charging or while playing games like pubg for continuously about 45 min .
no fast charging or any screen protection but you will get the whole protection damage from flipkart at rs99 .
under rs15000 best mob. nd best battery power backup . camera is not good
first of all i hate to hear that there is no return policy only we can exchange .
and camera is very very bad .
touch is not working something times .
and some times call options like speaker , dial pad , ect not showing immediately when we place call .
a very decent , underrated phone in the sub-15k price segment .
i decided to buy this over the likes of xiaomi , moto and samsungs of the world and i am truly fond of this phone .
the performance is great , the camera is good if not great and the battery performance is also encouraging .
camera can be underperforming sometimes .
not really a drawback .
wow excellent product and work very well in any condition very nice product by asus and timely delivery by flipkart thanks .
go for it if you have in two minds it is low rate , high performance , and quality assurance , after sales service.only few mean 2 bugs is there 1st - battery draining issue , 2- camera quality .
worst camera performance please don &apos;t buy it
product is good for this price range .
camera - not excellent but good for 16mp , camera gets hanged every now and then .
processing speed - good .
none of other brands are giving 6gb variant for 12999 .
battery : excellent gets complete charged in around 1 : 30 hours .
looks : superb. blue one is awesome !
some of the reviews have given correct detailed description .
finger print and face unlock are slow .
display and touch is not good. touch respond very slow and even some time no response as well
right now as a smartphone it &apos;s my one of good choice of my life and sound quality really awesome .
it &apos;s a nice phone .
but where is gallery
some important features left behind asus company ; example applock is not here and automatic hotspot not shutdown when nobody in use , call recording function also miss in new phone .
no dual app , now a days it &apos;s very important .
no screenshot option in menu .
ringtone not able to set for a long time .
battery drain little fast .
it &apos;s like normal mobile .
the things which are not present in this phone
1- data transfer speed option not present
2- fingerprint pic click not present
3- double tap to on the screen is not working properly sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work .
5-live wallpaper not supported by this phone
good about this phone
2- battery jabardast long lasting 1 day if u play whole day pubg
bad about this phone
1.i bought asus zenfone max pro m1 black color . but flipkart send blue color .
2.battery automatically drain without any heavy use and some time is heat .
other thinks okay .
all the best of model in asaus perfetly nice mobile in under 15 k
overall performance of phone is quite impressive .
i &apos;m not sure why this mobile was delivered on 9th day : ( i was eagerly waiting for the delivery but flipkart made me to wait for 9 days .
i &apos;m yet check the mobile condition .
i &apos;m giving 4 stars though considering the great discount ️
good mobile for fastest users people .
battery needs to be monitored .
phone is excellent in all other aspects from an ex mi owner .
mi beware of a zen attack .
its profesor is good speed works on internet but main problum is ntwork like during the call internet leave network connection and call network also have not support properly , speaker calling not support etc .
i got my phone today. still now its performance and its battery backup is awesome. but with camera im not satisfied ( it may be improved by several software update )
thanks flipkart for the fastest delivery
and the product is awesome value for money if your budget is under 15k go for it
mobile phone is sleeky , light weight performance is really gr8 but not fully satisfied with front camera .
at the time of clicking pix with front camera resolution will be gr8 but once you opened the taken pix quality will not upto the mark .
speaker is fantastic , speed and look is gr8 overall value for money fone
l like this mobile .
just now i bought it.later l will tell you
but the camera is not soo good as expected
and slow fingerprint and face id
otherwise everything is good
bought 6gb model during bb sale .
i was specific about few specs like performance , pure android , decent display and battery .
as for electronics , there is no resale value so did not want to spend more money .
performance - stock android is seamless and no unwanted apps to clog memory and drain battery .
sd 636 works beautifully .
no heating issue while playing videos and calling .
haven &apos;t played any games yet .
fast delivery so thanks to flipkart .
i purchased this mobile 11700 / - in flipkart offer time .
6gb ram so fast application open .
good phone but battery life is not good accepted 5000mh battery
secondary camera rating 10 / 10
overall mobile rating 10 / 10
it &apos;s very good under the budget , nice camera and battery back up
asus should provide a better camera app than existing , snapdragon 636 supports far better image quality to be captured by camera , so asus should provide better software support for camera in coming updates , all in all a very good phone in 11k price range .
1. no issue in finger print sensor .
its lightning fast after september update .
2. average camera , hd video recording without image stabilization , but thanks to september updates .
a secret method to unlock advance camera feature. just open setting s and tap 6 / 7 times in red-eye reduction option .
3. ultra super battery. playing pubg 6hr .
and battery still 40 %
5. sound is louder than regular , but not 3d type .
good but there is no gorilla glass available with the phone
all good but in camera when we use flash n take close pics it becomes completely bright n pictures are lost .
asus plz work on this and fix it in the next update
one of the cheapest available smartphone with 6gb ram and 5000 mah battery .
it comes with sd 636 and its performance is really good .
its camera is quite improved .
performance of the phone is excellent in this budget range .
i have played pubg and other games with high graphics without any lagging issue .
camera is good not excellent but satisfying .
battery backup is mind blowing ( reason to buy this phone ) .
overall still best phone in this range
nice mobile this mobile is very nice
awesome product nice image quality , sound quality
good with performance , but very poor camera compared with competitors
only day camera is good. but in night selfie camera is good in 6 gb ram varient .
best battery , best display , best specifications and quality .
mobile was but little bit problem with the screen and faceunlock was not working properly .
features in had must have to be improve more .
best product with valued money .
i have been using the phone for about one month and counting , so lets be honest here
battery- best in class .
easily 9 hours screen on time with heaving games like pubg .
performance-636 does the job .
memory and dedicated slot-64 gb + 6 gb ram + a slot is all you need for a 15k mobile ( price may have changed ) .
display- not the best , but best in the segment .
os : not pure android one .
but still good experience .
asus support- yeah , they have a good online forum and tech support .
awesome product at this budget price wid great quality .
first of all thanks to flipcart , delivery in 24 hr . . and so amazing phone , rear camera so nice but front camera i don.tike , otherwise all things are good
battery performance is down after 630mb software update
this phone is the best in it &apos;s price range .
but asus needs to fix the battery drainage problem .
asus is just awesome. mobile is beast unbeatable performance. camera is superb but camera app is old. if asus would give gcam it will be perfect and competite with flagship
best phone in this price
everything is perfect , only miss the trendy notch also the shutter speed is low
very new asus zenfone max m1 pro is better than other phones and performance is very fast and quickly
pros and cons after 1 month usage . ( 6gb variant ) no obvious remarks .
1 ) no heating issues while charging or heavy usage .
2 ) b + main camera quality .
4 ) good ram optimisation , thanks to android 8.1 .
1 ) inspite of massive 5000 mah battery , the usage is poorly optimised .
phones with 4k mah battery compete closely in a battery drain test .
2 ) no gestures , need to use standard android buttons .
3 ) no quick charging .
face and finger lock for this budget range
i had bought this products one month before its amazing .
this type of specificates at this price range is unbelivable
seriously it &apos;s value for money phone
i m using asus phone from 3 years and jo purchased this phone i m am very very satisfied its a great phone in this price memory processor ram all r great
many time some application not responsible and automatically close app .
i think it &apos;s h not good performance
little bit problem in camara need a update for camara
and problem in connecting wifi .
it will disconnected sevral times and take long time to sreach wifi network
asus 6gb variant is mi killer .
just buy it. best phone within 15k .
great phone , great battery life ( 4.5 / 5 ) even after playing pubg i get 1day of battery , decent camera ( 4 / 5 ) superb ram management , just value for money budget killer .
asus done a good job .
camera needs to be improved dramatically .
i have been using the phone for almost a week and completely satisfied with the performance except for the 4g speed .
i was using the same sim card in a different phone untill i purchased asus zenfone max pro m1 and the 4g download speed was satisfactory .
asus either need to check the hardware or firm ware and fix the issue .
if the issue is fixed it &apos;s the best value for money smart phone considering the price and the specs under the hood .
nice one but nokia is best option than this
one of the best phone in 15k range , camera is not good as redmi note 5 pro but overall asus zenfone beats redmi note 5 pro or any other phone in 15k range .
good product but internet speed possaser is slow due to which data signal flactute
its a very good phone .
clean android and jawdroping battery life ( at the end of the day after heavy usage battery is 50 % ) are the selling points .
it is totally worth it .
camera is not actually bad the interface is the problem .
if you leave it on auto then there is a chance that it might not get good shot but if you choose proper mode according to lighting conditions it gives amazing results .
overall everything is good .
performance wise beast but little bit disappointed expected more from battery .
battery should give more backup
display 3 / 5 because the brightnes varies unexpected , even the phone stays in a constant light area .
i have bought this phone a 2 months back .
it is a true value for money .
performance of asus zenfone max pro 1 is good and value for money to buy
touch sensor of screen dose not work properly
i had used this in 7 days only .
7th day from purchased , mobile display totally not working .
i had complaint to replacing in flipkart .
but still they didn &apos;t replacing .
iam disappointed to purchased this phone .
and i never to purchase again in flipkart .
this is by far the best phone phone priced in mid-range segment .
performance is great with the snapdragon 636 octa core aided by 6 gb ram .
i did not find any glitch while playing heavy games like asphalt9 and pubg .
the best part iis the massive 5000 mah battery which juices the phone as expected .
dual camera is also good but not great .
edge detection of portrait is good .
ph was awesome camera is good but battery is the best sound also nice over all is the best phone under 15000
if asus give more software update to it
then it will be mid range smartphone king .
very nice product and flipkart service is very good andfast
the only mobile which offers full hd + display , 6gb of ram , snapdragon octa core processor , triple slot , dual 4g volte , finger print , face unlock and cast screen under 15,000 / -
the best thing is it offers 5000 mah battery and thanks to asus for its best price .
camera quality is just above average .
face recognition is very poor .
camera performance is just ok as edge detection in portrait mode is not good. display and battery are up to the mark .
i just hope that asus will upgrade quality of face recognition by some update .
i booked a black colour phone .
but i get blue .
item have battery draining problem and also we can &apos;t get camara everytime sometimes will get camara . and the important thing is filpcart doesn &apos;t replace this product .
after 2 weeks i found only once the phone hanged just for few seconds .
6 gb ram is awesome .
gaming is flawless .
believe me , if you use asus charger , it charges very fast and also on the lock screen your can see &quot; charging rapidly &quot; .
awesome display quality .
and this phone has the best speaker compared to any phone if any price in the market .
camera could be slightly better , but it &apos;s fine .
this phone is just awesome
awesome phone in this budget. delivery was fast flipcart does a great job in delivery
product is very good in this price range thanks
perfect phone in budget .
most worth phone in this range
one of the best budget phones under 15k , if we compare any other flagships devices .
ram and storage is great.well built screen and vivid colors .
one of the cons are doesn &apos;t support 5ghz of wifi network .
as it old predecessor zenfone 2 was supporting .
rest all better and worth for its price
this mobile is just awesome .
blindly go for this , super performance .
in every aspect it is better than redmi phone inthis price range except camera images .
very good ram management
hello , this is uttam singh and i &apos;m writing the review of this phone after using it a week .
i switched to this phone after one and half yr using mi redmi note 4 .
so i give u guys some unbaised point of views--- &amp; gt ;
1.good battery : asus claims the battery to be a 5000mah and it is good infact but as far as compared with mi redmi note 4 &apos;s 4100mah both have same backup and you even wouldn &apos;t notice it .
so you can &apos;t say its far beyond the mi redmi note 4 .
superb smartphone under budget 15000 .
- &amp; gt ; camera omg what a camera u can &apos;t believe is it really 15000 phone , both camera front and rear superb
- &amp; gt ; audio output is great , it &apos;s clear sound and louder then other smartphones .
- &amp; gt ; support dual 4g volte ( u can access 2 jio sim on this phone or u can access one airtel 4g volte and one jio 4g volte )
i got this phone on august 2nd , was waiting for the perfect update for to review this phone , review after using the phone about 2 months
1 screen was misbehaving
2 camera app slow and not working properly sometimes
3 sometimes battery drains quickly ( around a day )
4 fingerprint scanner not working properly or slow
5 face unlock not working every time
1 not much heating
4 display very good for watching movies and playing games
after using the 6gb variant for exactly one month , here &apos;s some of my thoughts :
it &apos;s amazing how good this phone performs even with heavy games .
no lag or heating issue while playing games like pubg .
while the selfie camera can definitely get better , the rear cameras are quite good at this price .
unlike redmi note 5 pro and other mi phones , the pics look more natural .
i love this as it gives you more options to edit pics yourself , rather than the cameras doing it for you .
far better than xiaomi products .
it &apos;s best in this price in terms of battery and performance .
as well as camera , display also could &apos;ve been better if they provided gorrilla glass .
after using about a month , i can &apos;t really complaint about anything in this price range .
i just want asus to provide software update for optimizing battery life to avoid fast draining and regular system updates for overall system thereby overcoming the bad reviews .
rest all is good about the product
after one month use .
now the most important. camera
if u like a real colour image with great quality then go for it without any doubt but if u like edited unnatural over saturated pics then guys this is not for u .
battery is not working as 5000 mah , it &apos;s likely 4200 mah .
that &apos;s why the phone should get 4 stars in my experience .
about service from the centers in west bengal i have still no idea bcoz it &apos;s new phone
it &apos;s only useful for gamers nothing more than a gaming device .
far better then mi note pro 5 under 15 k .
best app and top quality of products must use once
best mobile at this price
and better than redmi note 5 pro
very nice phone under rs.15000 with 6gb ram
this phone is awesome. may improve a bit via updates tho .
the camera isn &apos;t the best but it does the job .
performance is awesome tho i saw few frame drops after gaming for long sessions. little heating too.but the phone is good
just go for it guys
awesome killer at this sagment !
good and battery is very very supper
not good this phone. not better this phone. camera quality is very poor. bettery is very week !
mashallah phone performance best
nice phone.nice build quality.good battery backup.no heating and no lagging problem.rear camera is good .
waiting for android 9.0 update release .
used for one month -- &amp; gt ; processing very fast , battery superb , played games like pubg , modern combat 5 no issues at all , using two sim card with one memory card working fine no heating issue .
honest review of the mobile after nearly 2 months of use :
1 ) mobile glass : 4.5 / 5 : it is dinorex t2x-1 glass manufactured by nippon electric glass ( japanese company ) at par with gorilla glass or even better .
so , don &apos;t worry about your mobile glass getting scratches or fracturing , but if you want to go ahead with a tempered glass then go for it .
2 ) battery : 5 / 5 : it easily last 2 days on average and sometimes even 3 days ( if you are an average user ) .
3 ) camera : 4.5 / 5 : camera is great .
it has poor call speaker . n call voice quality is also bad
battery performance is out of this world .
i was amazed by it and rapid charging is also good , can charge it from 0-90 % in almost 120 min.appx.
bought the phone on 8th september .
lightweight 0hone with exceptional battery life .
but after15 days the fingerprint sensor has stopped working .
great phone. but camera fps could have been higher. but who else is giving these features below 15k ? ?
no any good company except asus. so i m loving this phone. performance is great. loudspeaker tends to have unclear sound at very high volumes. over all great value for money
overall performance is good but camera is not satisfied
the only problem i face is network .
it is so bad that i want to smash the phone. the network keeps disconnecting evry 5 seconds and the speed is abysmal .
excellent photography , it &apos;s like a photo taken with a dslr camera
over all performance 3.5 just ok not good
simply superb , firstly thanks to flipkart for record breaking delivery within 11 hrs .
when comes to the mobile , it &apos;s awesome with tremendous performance in terms of battery and speed of processor .
stock feel of android is excellent .
camera can be improved .
people who are complaining of small things , should know that it is a stock android .
i liked zenfone gestures .
excellent phone in this range .
only compromising thing is camera in low light and indoor conditions .
otherwise in outdoor conditions camera performance is decent .
powerful processer , very good display , also i have seen in one of the youtube drop test video , it is survived two death drop test. amazing .
camera very wrost pls otherwise all performance ok
i buy 2 asus zenfone max pro m1 phones .
i love the service of flipkart its very fast .
i love config of this phone.im using it and its run os very smoothly .
i got 2 updates from asus after i buy this phone .
awesome machine at budget price !
performance like a beast .
camera is good , capture actual image not beautified which is great .
speaker is loud .
6gb ram too awesome
everything is awesome about it
don &apos;t just think . buy it
it will be good decision to buy this one .
no bugs yet in my device .
i am giving five star because 5 star review display first .
following issue are there in asus max pro m1 since inception of this device but there is no update by asus team and asus replying like anything :
gives you the best of the smartphone keeping you pocket friendly as well .
and overall a good design and performance device .
thanks to filpkart for fast delivery in 2 days .
wow great work by asus.nice performance
best phone under 20k and get more specs than redmi note 5 pro at same price
this product is best for the value .
flipkart delivered it in 2 days .
asus could have bundled earphones with it to make the deal sweeter .
nice fone with good speed love it
screen os also good .
both camera is okay .
unlock with face in low light also .
good product for heavy users .
playing pubg for 1 hour battery drop 14 % no heating at all
asus is constantly providing updates .
so don &apos;t worry about the bugs .
the best phone ever i used
beast , excellent performance , value for money.it is king in midrange .
just an awsum phone .
if you want a camera phone , don &apos;t go for it .
if you want everything else , then nothing is better than this .
few times other caller can &apos;t able to listen me there is some issue with my device i think i need replacement # flipkart
it &apos;s hang after 6 gb ram .
after updating , battery is draining too fast and now fast charging is also not supported .
it charged in expected 6 to 10 hours .
this phone is now become too heated while charging or without , and while internet accessing .
camera are average , not better then mi note 5 pro and more times it &apos;s shows camera error .
sometimes finger print lock is delay to unlock and not working .
i am feeling like cheated to buy this .
good mobile u must go for it asus zenfone max pro m1 6 gb ram overall i will rate 5 / 5 as it &apos;s good for all both camera , performance nd battery all is good under 15k .
really a great product from asus .
it &apos;s very fast , smooth and clean .
stock android feels amazing .
both cameras are also very good in this 6 gb variant .
gaming performance is excellent .
you can play games even at high graphics .
it may lag sometimes at high graphics but not always .
no problem with network connectivity .
must buy when you wish to buy a highly configuration phone is low budget .
it &apos;s good to see that asus providing good specifications at 15000 , overall mobile perform is phenomenal , but only thing i need to mention is i was ordered for black but recieved blue its really dissapointment .
only need improve camera quality .
overall phone is awesome .
excellent value for money product of aug2018 which came well packed ; and flawless delivery by flipkart .
the camera is bad , i have a redmi note 5 pro and oneplus 6 , this is more like a china phone camera .
battery life is awesome , this can handle pubg really well med settings at high framerates , lighter games run at max settings , the os is just barebones , not many settings or customisations , it is fluid no lag whatsover .
display looks better in manual brightness mode .
all over this is a best mobile under 20k
if you want best camera experience you have to install g-camera
super b mobile good product
awesome product , complete value for money mobile
the phone is good value for money , and specially the 5k mah battery is awsome .
the only week point of this phone is front camera , dont get me wrong it &apos;s not a deal breaker though .
awesome phone under 15000 .
i ordered this phone on 10 sept but after 2 days it got a discount of 500 rs .
so i cancelled and ordered another and received it on 14 sept. really awesome phone and the best part is 5000 mah battery .
i m a moderate user and you really have to charge every two days .
the only drawback about this phone is camera .
in dark the camera struggles a lot but its managable .
phone in day light are awesome .
go fot it guys you can &apos;t get a better deal than this .
now the time of direct video calling.but there is no direct video calling option in this phone.this is very bad .
the primary camera could have been slightly better than what it is .
and the default camera doesn &apos;t have manual mode .
while closing apps , it doesn &apos;t show the ram usage , although you can check it in the developer options .
the navigation bar will always show unless you &apos;re playing games or watching videos .
the battery is sick !
i get 10-15 hours of screen usage depending on what i do .
the phone is really nice but has only one disadvantage as it does not have a gorilla glass but is very good in all other aspects performance is awesome complete value for money good battery life and nice experience
it &apos;s a nice device nice display high performance battery good looking , camera is superb dual camera setup is ossam , i like it , just for 14499
5 star for battery .
i have shifted from expensive phones to this one only for battery and ram .
nothing to beat it. go for it if you are heavy user and i bet you don &apos;t need to carry power banks anymore
good phone but need to upgrade camera both
an excellent product and flipkart &apos;s awesome speedy delivery .
camera - really good in capturing static objects and in dim lightings , i could capture clouds in the evening clearly with this phone .
battery life - unbeatable .
no heating issue so far .
performance - smooth and more than enough
hardware - cool .
design - very cool .
i got blue one
stock android - cool cool .
must buy , with little compromise which you can expect in any budget phones below 25k
hat &apos;s off to asus , for this wonderful product
battery is not so much as we expected , i have replaced for three times , and camera portrait mode have some problem it takes time for processing , if these issues resolve , phone is awesome , best phone in this price range. only require reqular updates to improve performance. qr code scanning not working in current update also miss split screen option .
this mobile is amazing but it dosnt provided gorilla glass
touch is not up to the mark compared to it &apos;s peers .
cannot delete few pre-installed stock apps like facebook , messenger , instagram etc. rest of the things are good and provide better value for money .
most budget friendly device in 15000 segment
better than redmi note 5 pro great work asus
totally value for money .
nothing much to say about the 5000 mah battery .
the three slots in the time of hybrid slot is like a fresh air
thanks a lot flipkart .
fully satisfied with flipkart .
everything good so far.as expected.compact and smooth .
missed the old customisable zen ui though .
wish there are more camera features and a music player other than google play music .
1st i would like to say that this is an awesome device and it s not much stylish and updated in design .
new device update had made the device smooth and camera is super cool now , but still the camera app interface is too bad .
hatsoff to asus to provide a better pure android device in india .
iam waiting for the optimization and updates in future .
go for it , if yur budget is 15k .
pls opt for 6gb variant to get the 16mp frnt cam variant. wich is better than other variants .
excellent phone at a reasonable price .
performance is awesome , battery superb .
thanks to flipkart for quick delivery
very fast delivery with in 20 hours. thanks flipkart .
in one word great phone
excellent phone just go with it if u r confused with mi note 5 pro
best phone in this price range .
i would even say one of the best even if compared to higher price range phones that range around 20-25 .
gaming performance is optimum no doubt .
that 6gb ram combined with snapdragon 636 and a 5000 mah battery is just a match made in heaven .
played a performance hungry game like pubg for over 4 hours continuous after full charging and on max settings and there were no heating issues at all .
hell , the phone dint even get warm , heating is a longshot .
thanks flipkart for quick and in time delivery of my
asus znfone max pro m1 ( gray ) .i am writing my review after 13 days .amazing and mind blowing smart phone in it &apos;s range .
i am very happy with the performance of asus zen fone maxpro m1.all functions of asus is ok , the only lakuna is with camera.2nd lakuna is no provision of gorrila glass .
under 15k with all features best in market but after my purchase it &apos;s price reduced 500 so little bit disappointed
excellent mobile at this price range , frankly speaking better than redmi products , blindly go for it.i have purchased 6gb ramand64gb rom blue color variant.im just loving the blue color.in love with android one
one of the best phones in market in a budget of 15k .
it &apos;s performance is awesome .
battery life is amazing .
display is also good .
a phone recommended for users for whom camera is secondary and performance is priority .
amazing quality but after the use 6 months i face slight lag while playing pubg
excellent phone in 15k .
mind blowing performance with great features .
thank u so much flipkart for quick delivery and many many thanks to asus team for developing this awesome device in a budget with great features .
asus team please keep it up
i order black color but i received blue color
i thought a lot between note 5 pro and max pro m1 .
i regret my decision going with asus .
battery weakened in a month .
camera doesn &apos;t work many times .
it doesn &apos;t even feel like new phone for me .
seriously disappointed with camera though .
cell is pretty nice and all the fuss about camera is wrong.its camera is almost same as rn5pro only difference is of front camera only which differ by 16 and 20 .
only big con in this is battery drainage occurs fast after using 15 days and even 5000mah massive battery fails to manage that.overall its a must buy .go for it without thinking
even camera has got better after update .
excellent smartphone in this category .
just awesome. go for it
best in class ️
awesome phone in 15k range
all good i am using it for 13days and its too smooth and fast .
value for money under 15000
very nice but not clear picture in low light
great phone , all rounder , i like it .
fingerprint is not working properly
awesome mobile. awesome camera i like it. fantastic battery backup .
best phone under 15k go for it you wont regret
seriously just awesome mobile at this price it &apos;s best i &apos;m very satisfied .
at fast i &apos;m confuse which phone i buy then when i buy asus zenfone max pro m1 and use i said that it &apos;s better than &quot; mi note 5 pro &quot; just love it
amazing phone with monster of a battery .
doesn &apos;t heat at all .
true value for money in this range .
this is my first online mobile purchase.after searching alot i bought this mobile.now for rs.15000 / - you can get everything battery , performance , camera , sensors .
the body is too good.does not get overheating even playing high end games like pubg , asphalt 8. and easily a day &apos;s battery in 2 hours charge and about amazing 9 hours of screen on time. worth to buy ️
nice product but there are not earphones
best value for money .
believe me , it &apos;s the best in class. thanks asus thanks flipkart
all over good camera
i will write my honest opinions after 10 days of use .
pros : -1 ) quick delivery 2 ) classy touch 3 ) sd636 duel volte awesome 4 ) can switch sim during call 5 ) battery life is great lasts 3 days for nomral users 1.5 days for heavy 6 ) stock android better than any ui .
7 ) nice camera 8 ) value for money
cons : - no major cons
my always loving asus is gud some cam and speaker issues other wise too good performance
it &apos;s good phone for good rate
best phone for me .
battery back up is superb .
awsome display and also the sound quality .
no heating issue .
no gorilla glass tempered glass must .
i loved this phone
super performance , amazing battery , worth buying
best and perfect product under 15000 with 6gb ram
i loved it. just awesome phone .
black color of panel seems to be shining blue in sunlight .
it &apos;s worth the money but if they had made the camera app more efficient. i mean if they had installed the asus pixelmaster for dual camera then we can pull out the real power of the camera
for every hour battery percentage drops to 5 % on regular usage on heavy usage of gaming drops 10 % every hour
pics are not as good as note 5 pro no stability in capturing video
performance is best never slows down i installed 49 apps and still works like pro 20 high resolution games
tested with multi tasking and works perfectly
if you were looking for performance and battery
this is the perfect phone
most packed featured mobile under 15000
asus had done a great job
the one and the only disadvantage is it &apos;s network connection and mark my words network connection is too bad till now and there is no update .
and the gorilla glass but it can be replaced with a good temper .
plz help look after the network. cause itz not the best value for money phone until it &apos;s networking is fixed .
this phone is awesome except it &apos;s camera .
i am giving it &apos;s 2star because of the selling strategy of asus that they are giving 500 ₹ off after i buyed it .
again flipkart was best at his side deserve 10 / 10 .
battery backup 2 / 5 in comparison of mi phone 4000 mah battery , if you are buying it for 5000 mah battery like me then i will suggest you to go for mi6 or mi6 pro .
this is a must buy smartphone till writing of this review ( 10sep2018 ) in 15k .
this phone is a killer and capable of doing everything .
go for 6 + 64gb grey variant as it is more attractive than black variant .
it killed redmi note 5 pro in many aspects .
go for it if you have a budget of 15k .
i love it &apos;s performance .
this very beautiful looking.no problem found
can &apos;t say in words simply astonishing product from flipkart .
luckkly asus released 6gb variant which is one of the lasting performance as well as superior performance .
this mobile is so osom
amazing product , especially the blue color variant looks stunning .
thanks to flipkart also , got phone in 48 hours .
camera , fingerprint and face unlock needs to be improved .
i will rate phone 8.5 / 10 at now .
i am using that mobile from last 1 month .
and seriously the device is awesome .
it has many features
amazing phone for 15000 value for money .
perfect mobile. speed nd fast. battery life no words. just awsme . !
like the product but the touch sense need improvement and there is no ir port and the quality of the screen is not so good its only hd not fhd
battery is not two day long
i did &apos;t feel like using new phone because my old phone is also from asus .
this performance is better than that more over price is only 1000 ₹ higher than my old phone .
but asus has to improve in camera
awesome asus super fast performance and battery also good product super mobile
ignore haters just go for it. beats redmi note 5 pro
phone speed ok but camera quality average battery backup super
this phone is just superb in class .
it &apos;s a tuff competitor in the range .
awesome phone but i ordered for grey colour received rose gold
good one. grate speed
value for money , its a perfect alrounder , each update improves the performance of the phone , amazing display quality , battery performance is excellent .
low light camera performance is the only problem i noticed .
great phone , there were some problem with fingerprint scanner but after update it is working great got biometrics problems fixed .
equilizer was removed after update
battery capacity is high
no heating while operating only heats in pubg high frame rate that too little .
selfie camera works good
ram management is great ( thanks to stock android )
the phone speed is very first
excellent phone in 15k price , asus best phone so far. company is also providing silicon back cover case which was a surprise .
good phone but asus is not sticking to the unique selling point of this phone .
i am writing this review after alomost 2 months use .
unique selling point of this phone was 5000 mah battery which is not good .
battery draining like anything .
5000 mah should least last for 16 hours but it just gives maximum 12 hours which any other phone will give you .
once the phone is fully charged , without even running any apps it starts utilizing the battery and drains almost 5 % in 15-20 mins .
i am satisfied with our service
super phone with nice design .
it feels very premium in hands .
please prefer blue colour while buying the phone because black colour gets smudges on back while we touch
best phone in the world
value for money upto this date
best phone i has been ever used
my companion from now on .
ram management and battary backup is awesome
superb phone in 15k ️ ️
the phone is upto expectation .
1. the battery is powerful
2. the camera is average with a bit of focussing issue .
3. the display is good .
4. the network reception is good enough .
5. the built quality is good .
6. the performance is upto the mark .
7. no heating observed .
1. the camera could have been better .
2. the fingerprint unlocking speed can be much faster .
3. the supplied charger cable is so tiny that you wont be above to charge it everywhere .
4. the device is damn heavy .
overall performance is good
but lacks many basic features and cons like
3.no screenshot tile in notification panel
5.finger print unlock is slow and inaccurate
6.charging time is nearly 3 hours ( 2 hours and 45 mins )
7.camera is just ok ( if camera is your main preference don &apos;t buy this phone )
8.ringtones are awful ( may not be considered by many )
very good . sonu patel
very nice phone and good working
excellent phone , battery performance is fabulous , ram management , excellent camera , no heating issues , no lags , display is very good
excellent one in this price range # bestperformer
thank u asus for a excellent product
i love the way it works
fully satisfied after having this product , stands out to be the best smartphone at this price , there is no issue with the camera , it gives high resolution photos , just an addition of eis would add a cherry on the cake .
i ordered the device last month , in hopes that the phone will live up to its hype , sadly it doesn &apos;t .
called up flipkart for a replacement , rejected as the problem had subsided temporarily , but surprisingly it &apos;s back .
5000 mah should last 2 days , not charge twice a day
also camera tends to not work , total hit or miss
really the worst phone i ever bought .
camera is not good , battery is easily drained , it &apos;s taking 3h ours to charge and is discharging very quickly .
so buy any other phone and please don &apos;t waste money on this one it &apos;s not worth buying .
awesome product by asus
no heating , lag free , smooth operation , lite weight , much more qualities .
in short it &apos;s a value for money product .
camera not satisfied but protrait mode is super comparing to others
built quality is excellent
great within 24 hours phone is delivered , performance of d phone is awesome
awesome battery back up ( 3 days ) , random working ( 2 days ) .
very fast proceessing and no hanging problem .
picture of rear camera is awesome performing , just look as fresh and natural image .
the image of front ( selfie ) camera is seemed just like fresh , neat and clean and natural ( not artificial ) .
# error !
very nice and smart looking .
the colour of my phone is grey although i wanted to have
i had recently purchased asus zenfone max pro 6gb variant and this was first time i thought of buying an asus phone .
but i think it &apos;s not up to the mark .
it &apos;s 6 gb variant feels like3gb and hangs a lot while opening apps and performing normal functions .
and the black color is really different rather looks bluish .
best phone in tha price
amazing back camera and great battery backup loved it but needs some updates to the camera
awesome mobile with good battery specifications performance ram management is superb and it &apos;s a true dual 4g volte smartphone if you have 15k go for it : )
it delivered within 2 days from order but not able to open selfie camera every time it says &quot; camera server died closing camera &quot; redmi note 5 pro is better option instead of asus zenfone max pro m1 .
i recommend to all don &apos;t buy this product .
shipping is on time , without concern the problem of flood in kerala , i &apos;m so happy with flipcart experience , i got an awesome phone , thank you flipcart
liked this device , unexpected surprise .
though stock camera is not up to the mark but enough to capture images in outdoor conditions .
install google camera and get stunning outputs .
i am new to stock android and i am a bit confused of searching things .
can &apos;t find vault in this .
battery is awesome.waiting it to discharge so that i can charge to 100 % .
display is very nice .
though there is no gorilla glass protection , screen looks like there is no need for that .
really superb mobile i ordered on 1st sale still now i &apos;m not faced any problem loved it
simply superb loved so much
products is good but if camera was made of good quality .
two best thing i like most is battery backup and 6 gb ram
camera is good compairing with any other phone in this range .
fingerprint scanner little slow .
sound quality good , if you are not camera or brand lover you can choose this .
after using the phone for 10 days .i am giving the review .
best phone at this price
got improved camera &apos;s when compared with 3gb and 4gb variant phones. best quality in camera &apos;s both front and rare potrait shots are awesome
dedicated sim slot is plus point
finger print is not upto the mark
awesome phone in that price
worth to buy but still it needs an software update
if you don &apos;t play heavy games then battery lasts for 2 days
camera is good enough .
no lagging , fast no signal problems , etc .
great value for money .
awesome mobile. very happy for good quality
nice phone for the
all is well but .
even 16 mp camera but not satisfied .
delivery was awesome within 24 hr
we can change colour. but also it is little warm. that is the only problem. i loved its speaker. it is very crisp and clear and the boom box also helped me. thanks flipkart
features is good but faceunlock is not good performance .
faceunlock is not good
guys , if u are looking for the phone under 15k for 6gb / 64gb in comparision with mi note 5 pro 64gb .
just go for this .
it is complete value for money .
cons : - slow motion mode not available , however mi have that one .
but other features are same .
best mid range phone. just love this .
the features of mobile at this price is just amazing !
and the performance is beast . !
simply the best . worth money. go for it
used to pay pubg and pes , i feel no lag or battery drain .
no words to say go for it guys never think for any other .
pubg runs very well .
no lag at all .
for me best thing is dual 4g at this price .
ram management is excellent .
overall a good phone .
excellent mobile and budget price
one of the best smartphone in this range .
red mi note 5 pro killer.plez add slow motion camera feature in update .
brilliant in this price , exceptional
camera video recording performance is not satisfactory .
flickering light appears in night video shots .
and have capability to challenge iphone x
and 80 % beated 1 + 6 .
looks like a royal mobile .
no lagging yet .
fast startup and boot .
even with pubg , and highier graphics and gb games .
conclusion is if you want everything buy this smart mobile other than redmi note 5 pro
it is so good looking .
if you are looking for the best value for money device for 15k , this is the best you can get .
great display with good outdoor visibility
probably the best speaker under 15
superb cameras ( install google camera and it becomes one of the best camera phones under 15k )
stock camera app is pure garbage
my best phone ever .
gaming is flawless with buttery smooth performance and huge bettery .
call quality is mind blowing .
true hd call experience is here .
i am happy with the sound , performance and battery .
battery lasts a day .
camera has been improved after aug patch update and its been doing good .
overall it &apos;s value for the money .
the battery being 5000mah is worse than redmi note 5 pro , which has 4000mah .
and the camera is a huge letdown .
best phone under 15k .
fingerprint sensor is not working after update
the asus zenfone max pro m1 is a good phone in 15k budget segment .
good processor , do not have heating issue .i have been using for a month now and except for the camera it &apos;s pretty good .
the camera is not that bad either , it &apos;s a personal preference .
not so bad , can be improved though , but u can easily use it for the next 2 years .
good mobile. asphalt 9 legends download error problem in playstore. less features ( no long screenshot , no ir blaster , little bit camera software problem ) game performance 5 star , battery 5 star , storage 5 star. network 4 star , features 3 star
works great. its been 2 week now . no problem at all .
battery drain quickly as a 5000mah battery discharge quickly this is only one problem
i purchased 6gb variant.it &apos;s too good.all the features are super.specially battery backup and speed.awesome ph in this price .
need to improve camera with ota update , screen also not a gorilla glass so handle with care it is better to purchase temper glass along with it bcz outside temper glass are not available as of now , battery n performance are good .
overall below 15000 budget it is better mobile to buy .
6gb version has very good performance .
nice features and good price .
great phone this price .
best phone in 15k
it will not disappoint u. go for it .
camera amazing , performance amazing , no doubts , a good surprise for all types customers from asus .
the delivery was nice .
asus is awesome as always .
the phone works fine , but the major disappointment comes . when the headphone jack doesnt performs .
the 3.5mm jack which asus promising . does not connects my original sony headphones , bringing me a major disappointment .
sad. and disappointed i am a huge fan of music .
great phone at this price .
really appreciate its wonderful
hope asus will send new update to resolve the camera app interference issue .
people. what can i say ? ?
as it &apos;s absolutely rocking man. people who look for heavy usage of mobile. this is the correct choice . .
getting fulfilled all the expectations at a price of 15k is really called as &quot; value for money &quot; . ok ok folks. m too busy with this device .
nice phone . asus please update camera future
poor performance , after used 1 wk , giving review , not feeling of 6 gb ram , applications are not supporting very well , even portrate mode is not working some times , that pic do save some times .
camera application has very basic modes .
don &apos;t get confused , just have it and enjoy the seamless performance .
don &apos;t buy complete mobile protection 1 year , jeevas mobile protection not given any claim , just cheating with customer .
great phone under 15k .
fast , good for gaming and photography all in one very good phone in mid range amazing sound quality loudspeaker nice camera affordable price in gaming phone nice battery life
so far working good , no bugs , battery life is too good , stock experience is superb .
2.battery backup- almost a 1.5 day for heavy usage not gaming just what &apos;s app camera and fb and some apps
3.rear camera is ok but not ok on low light
4.standby is great not draining of battery like others say in forums
5.performance is great i didnot see any lags from till now. even heating. pubg supports high graphics
6.ram management is great
everything is good but fingerprint lock not working
battery life is awesome
face recognition and fingerprint sensor is superfast
performance is very good
overall value for money product
realy its a super phone , im using the phone last 15 days.amazing perfomance , mainly battery back up.i get 2 day batery , im using mainly youtube and more apps long time , no heating issue , thank you asus
very good mobile in less price. awesome product by asus
feels like i have battery issue .
my battery lasts justs 12 hours and this was observed after 20 days of usage ( return policy expired ) .
as per current usage , i expect it to last for max 48 hours , but it drains out in 12-16 hours .
satisfied with overall performance .
battery is the only issue .
being an asus user , compared to zenfone 2 , some features are lacking. like asus &apos; auto call recording feature , camera &apos;s panaroma , gif and timelapse add on features .
awesome phone from asus .
better battery backup , quality camera , good performance .
for this price it &apos;s a awesome phone no doubt .
switching from miui to stock android is but difficult but after some days of usage i &apos;m getting the hang of it .
great , it is awesome
200 percent value for money
in some reviews they said head phone is not working , there is no problem in that all head phone suits it and work very well
battery come around two days
camera is bit slow and auto focus is not good
other than that it &apos;s a best phone for everyone
extremely dissatisfied with the battery service. most ridiculous service. is it really 5000mah as been said ? !
it drains as fast as its less than 3000mah !
today morning i charged the phone 100 % .during the whole day i just use whatsapp and played pubg for 1hour.and now i put my phone on charge.how long the battery service it is . !
i am an asus lover. so i expect better camera as its with dual rear camera. but the camera quality is also not up to the mark. not even front camera .
its my first android phone .
its beautiful with the unique grey color .
performance with respect to speed and camera gets even better after fota updates from asus .
its better to order a tempered glass before u buy this amazing smartphone .
a true value for money indeed .
i am using it sincce four days without charging it after my first use .
i would stronglyrecommend this phone if your budget is less than 20k .
awesome phone better than mi note 5 pro
highly recommend product if you are hardcore gamer you should buy it. battery _ display _ stock ui easy to handles. but. wait the camera app is average .
after using 10 days
display auto brightness is not working properly
battery is not as expected device needs more optimization .
4000mah redmi phone is performing better than this .
some times incoming calls are not ringing but speaker is working very well after restarting the device the calls are ringing up to some time
this is best ever smartphone from asus under 15k .
battery and 6gb ram is the main power of this phone .
great display with full hd .
front and back camera are good at this price range .
very smooth performance no lacks .
smooth performance , the good quality display , and the incredible battery life on a regular basis .
asus zenfone max pro should be your top consideration if you &apos;re in the market for a budget android smartphone today .
first of all thanks to flipkart for fast delivery .
this phone is complete beast for the price .
talking about the looks yes it looks nice and feel good in hands .
next is the interface is really fast and smooth thanks to stock android ( 8.1 ) though it have some bugs hope they will fix it in future through ota updates .
coming to performance , it runs all the apps smoothly without any lag thanks to sd636 chipset .
good in price range .
best phone under 15000 k till date
only camera software snapdragon camera is buggy
amazing product with beautiful design and good spec with amazing camera and monster size battery amazing
.if your budget is below 20k. and you don &apos;t buy this. for sure you will regret later. haven &apos;t found any cons yet
nice mobile having great features
and battery life is awesome .
.instead of going to nokia 6.1 plus or redmi note 5 pro .
asus m1 6 gb ram .
still bugs are not fixed , from asus there is no official update
really the killer beast of redmi note 5 pro. very much satisfied with asus . slightly improvement needed on camera hope to be fixed
if you want to buy something amazing , you should buy this product .
awesome phone interms of hardware and software .
storage expandable to 2tb , ui is crisp n fast , android 8.1 ( can install android 9 also ) .
google gives 1tb storage linked to this device .
fingerprint scanner and face detection .
i was using moto g5s plus .
after than i purchased asus zenfone max pro m1 .
i think best display .
battery backup is good .
performance as expected from sd 636 awesome .
only i felt camera is weakness of this phone .
may asus can improve by giving updates .
i purchased this phone only for dual 4g .
so when every i recharged one sim than other sim are not going to work .
best phone with good quality
best budget mobile phone
the mobile is awesome and the delivery was very fast within 2 days so hats off to flipkart
thanks to flipkart for faster delivery .
this 6 gb variant is very good .
earliar i use redmi note 5 pro and now using this and i like this .
this mobiles performance is better than redmi note 5 pro .
camera is good not bad .
overall all this is best budget phone .
super value for money .
no issue , no lag , no heating issue and no battery drain .
battery life is awesome .
i am getting 1.5 and 2 days of usage .
8 to 9 hours of screenon time .
camera quality is little bit low .
when compared to asus zenfone max .
camera is unstable after getting updates. picture gets little blurred if your hands shake during click , pictures are still good quality
overall it &apos;s good phone and definitely value for money
we are expecting some updates to get camera stable
exlent phone mind blowing
handles everything with ease. masha allah !
but screen freezes sometimes .
best mobile for this price
nice phone in this budget battery is awesome great deal
super fast.sound superb , performance great .
i using phone since 2 days .satisfaction.go for
nice camera on daylight .
great work by flipkart ( on time delivery ) . and never the less the phone rocks
only one is redime not 5 pro killer that us one asus zen phone max pro m1 6 gb
because battery is good
ram management is good than note 5 pro
and main stock android is better than mui 9 in battery optim , one big difference in 5 pro and max pro you like pubg in redime on graphic is balance but in max you in hd graphic
awesome product massive battery backup and nice gaming experience .
played pubg at highest grpahics with full brightness for 4 hours without break and battery dropped from 85 % to just 39 % and not a single lag or frame drop through out gameplay
it should be supporting fast charging
must buy if your looking for performance phone .
but problem in fast charging and camera
good phone but vodafone volte not working on my device
cremera quality very good
good but look is average
value for money. but sim eject pin is missed in the box .
thanks flipkart for fast delivery .
thanks to flipkart for fast delivery , phone is a good in display and performance also but not in camera it &apos;s portrait mode is very bad. for camera waste of money
its a great phone with awesome features .
i will highly recommend this .
i have purchased both redmi note 5 pro 6 gb version and this with 6 gb version .
features and camera quality is same in both but zenfone max pro is having better battery life .
and it &apos;s coming with 2000 less price .
so i will recommend this over redmi note 5 pro .
fantastic mobile very nice
the best budget smartphone .
elegant and beautiful display .
great in hand feel .
what else do you want in 15k ?
just go for it
i just love it
better than redmi note 5 pro in every department
awesome. don &apos;t let me down anytime anywhere. it &apos;s perfect combination of style n specs
i have been using the phone for the last 1 week .
the only problem is the face recognition which is a bit slow and doesn &apos;t recognise your face in low light .
otherwise the phone is very good .
phone looks are awesome and performance as well
but its hard to find tempered glass for it .
potrait mode i.e bookeh iffect is very very poor. remaining all things are superb and perfect
camera very low quality better then 4gb varient
it &apos;s the best beast available for gamers at this price point .
overall i would give it 4.2 / 5
asus is doing great work thumbs up to asus
a best budget mobile with 15k .
i &apos;m totally satisfied with this product .
it can beat redmi note 5 pro .
i &apos;m surprised with camera .
camera is the best one with that price range .
this is a amazing device .
everything is just perfect .
i am getting 10 + hours screen on time on 4g network.and those who are complaining about camera please install gcam and then you will see the difference .
after installing gcam the camera performance is just like rn5pro i know it because my sister has rn5pro .
rear camera depth sensor for bokeh effect works only if the object is very close , in the range less than a meter whereas for lenovo k8 note plus the range is almost twice .
apart from it , this is really a beautiful phone and more than worthy for the price .
battery is a beast lasting for 2 days nearly , android &apos;s stock version is a feather in the cap .
beautiful portraits from the front cameras , acceptable ( but not superior quality ) of photos in low light .
6 gb variant is really worthy to have it .
processor is pretty fast
overall phone is awesome for the price love you asud
simply amazing but eis should be there in the next update and some pro camera features should also be made available .
this is the phone i dreamed .
it is so smooth , so quick and really smart .
it is definitely best phone in this price range .
camera quality is also very good .
fingerprint scanner - moderate
audio in ear piece ( in call ) and audio jack - worst .
fm radio sound is too much distorted and lot of noises - worst
phone is great but the only problem is it &apos;s camera .camera not so good
powerful mobile go for it. zakkas
very nice phone.better than note 5 pro .
nice phone for this price.camera is not bad.good features .
best budget mobile in 15k segment. rear cam is too good compared to mi note 5pro , front is also good , a good budget phone .
excellent battery backup and a great camera for detailed shots make this a beast .
gaming is also great with no lags. overall a good smartphone .
go for it only 6gb ram
pretty yaar , value for money .
am happy with it , and the brand am loving it .
best phone in the price range. value for money .
2 days regular use for one full charge , what more you can ask for ? ?
this phone handle high graphic game very well like pubg and also the battery when you play one hour pubg you will loss only 15 % battery .
i &apos;m happy with gaming and battery this phone easily beat mi .
outstanding product . i will vote this better than note 5 pro in every aspects except camera performance but asus is pushing it by software updates , though very good camera experiance . highly recommended device in this price segment .
i &apos;m happy with the product , but after seeing a 2000 rs price drop after just 2mnth of my purchase and after 3 mnth of phn launch , this really break my heart .
no complaints for a 6gb / 64gb variant .
asus gestures are very good and handy .
if you spend sometime on camera then it isn &apos;t bad at all infact good , but at time slightly off but still very good .
design : looks very good and has a 2.5d which adds the curvyness on the edges .
no gorilla glass but i am ok , will put a screen guard .
performance : best in class and beats most of the phones above its price range .
this gadget truely defines the meaning of android .
great mobile in 15000 .
currently no other mobile comes with these specifications in this price .
only camera is not upto the parameter .
but camera won &apos;t disappoint you .
on n all this phone is suberb and i don &apos;t think you regret your purchase .
i just bought this phone couple of days before and to tell you the pros :
the delivery received before as per scheduled .
battery backup very well two days battery backup display something very well
the handset is very good. even the flipkart service is also very good and nice
best best best phone i have ever had
i bought it on 9th of august sale. dont waste your time reading this review. click on the buy button and purchase it. definitely worth buying .

camera quality is good but not too much .
starting problem in camera .
great nice one , value for money thank you asus
very good device. but flipkart takes 6 days to deliver this product
overall the phone is good value for money .
battery consumption must be optimise
that all every thing is super in this phone
the asus zenfone max pro m1 6gb ram absolutely nails the basics and performs without compromising in any areas honestly there isn &apos;t much more you can ask for a budget phone .
i would consider it is a fastest and best budget phone in indian market right now !

i love this phone
it easily compete and beat redmi note 5 pro
it is lag proof mobile for gaming
switched from op 3 to this phone .
there are lot of bugs in the phone , like the wifi looses connection automatically and camera app crashes .
asus has been pushing updates and one thing gets a little better but then there is some other new bug .
asus need to improve camera of the mobile
excellent phone considering its price.i always prefer asus over mi.pros- battery , display , lag free performance , stock android cons- camera performance in low light conditions especially front cam , lack of any gorilla glass .
have to handel carefully.best buy in this price range .
hope asus providers least 2 major os updates and time to time updates.happy about thepurchase .
good sound quality and louder too
not much slim as it packs 5000mah
some major apps required like
front flash is not working maybe some settings have changed
low light photography not upto mark

lacks even basic things :
like you can &apos;t zoom a pic taken in cam app
no slow motion or any other mode
no option to click anywhere on screen
don &apos;t expect great photos , just normal pics .
else this is a master in all fields .
you can buy blindly .
good phone low price super camera fast working long battery.l very very happy
camera is not up to the mark .
5mp rear for focusing is just for name sake .
only good thing with in the range of 15k is 6gb ram and 5000 battery
believe me asus zenfone 2 camera is 1000 times better than this max pro1 camera
very very good phone , support true dual volte and fullhd + display make your experience very great with this phone .
and 8.1 is very good to use and user-friendly .
the awesome phone i &apos;ve bought in the budget in 15k .
this phone is all-rounder .
battery stays alive more than 1.5 days after playing pubg .
the best phone under 25k .
it &apos;s better than perfect
camera not as expected compared to other mobiles in this range .
good phone . but i need native video calling
i am fully amazed to see its battery performance .
must buy for anyone .
camera is also fine and in daylight its awesome .
no problem to buy it .
mobile is dope .
if you are confused between red mi note 5 pro 4gb varient and max pro m1 6gb varient .
zenfone is a clean winner .
except the camera , every other aspect is better in zenfone than note 5 pro .
excellent smart mobile with excellent performance and meet everyone expectation .
awesome phone with great specifications but screen is a bit yellowish
very nice device , i gifted this to my friend .
nice phone with amazing facilities .battery backup two days standing
this phone has the best battery and i love it
it &apos;s great in overall but u may think twice for 5000may
thanks to asus for a beautiful device- like touching device .
but it &apos;s fingerprint sensor and double tap to wake up feature . very disappointing. also sometime charging issues .
overall the interface is good though it doesn &apos;t have some call recording , applock , hide features .
battery is good enough .
standby draining is more .
sometimes ui forced closes not most of the time .
think ota updates will fix these .
expecting more updates from asus .
front cam disturbance is more 16mp doesn &apos;t justify picture quality .
my device has a mic problem some times a weird sound comes out of the speaker .
don &apos;t know whether its software problem or speaker problem .
camera 9 / 10 ( except night mode front camera )
touch is butterly smooth .
grey colour looks gorgeous .
overall excellent phone in this budget .
we &apos;ll each and every mobile has its pros and cons .
this mobile is very much with a pros than any other mobile .
i have bought 3 phones in the very first sale for me and my family .
after a week use writing this review .
overall the product is good .
but need a lot improvement in camera including stabilisation .
it is not fast in capturing images .
the images are often blurred while taking pictures unless you keep the camera for a bit time focusing on the object .
application run smoothly but some of the app &apos;s crashes so often like facebook jio music etc .
don &apos;t know whether it &apos;s the problem with the hardware or the application part .
i got 6gigs varient in the first sale. woooho !
it &apos;s super great phone on paper !
but just need some software updates to caught more eyes , specially in camera department i suggest replace snapdragon camera with some interesting zenskin camera , need more features to make it more cool .
also love 4k recordings but stabilization is super demanded , i think phone still be a true android .
no complains for battery related things .
i have no words its amazing
everything is ok for except the battery .
5000 mah but still lack of performing accordingly .
smartphone gives only a day battery life that &apos;s it .
my screen lock is not working
my honesty opinion is under 15k it &apos;s a amazing product which leads a lot of performance .
camera- rear camera is osm i am satisfied but front camera good but need some improvement of this
performance- sd 636 leads a vital performance which unbetable amazing i am using pubg many times no any lag issue .
battery- 5000 massive battery plays amazing role if you use it in normal system , its carried on 2 day backup .
if you used in heavy then it &apos;s shows 15-20 hour .
mobile is ok but touch problem irritating me .
hi this is the best phone as far as specifications is concerned. so don &apos;t think just go for it
this is very good
fantastic phone asus and all-over outstanding best in price and flipkart ( ekart service ) very good
gud looking nd fantastic view
missing my old phone yuphoria in terms of software features .
missing native video calling , auto call record option , gallery , file manager , some widgets
camera performance also not as expected for the given hardware .
fingerprint sensor is so fast and accurate.face unlocking also nice .better battery than any other phones .
overall good value for money .
phone is good but design may be improved
fully satisfied. worth the money. full confidence with battery life. super fast performance. camera average. premium look. excellent display. best budget phone under. overall full pakage
it &apos;s an awesome deal , my recommendation is just go for it and experience the best .
osm phone. i love it
so many new features
and after update the features are so muched improved
excellent product and design
i &apos;m fully satisfied this mobile
i brought tis product with dubious mind but on using tis product. finding it awesome by all means .
i now feel myself took right decision in buying tis fone of asus .
before tis never used any fone of tis co .
i would suggest blind purchase tis model fone of 6gb ram asus co &apos;s zenfone .
best smartphone in 15k with 6gb ram and camera is good its better than redmi note 5 pro .
i &apos;m with 6gb beast , battery king
great value for me .
few bugs are still there which can be removed from ota updates .
very nice phone , with stock android
totally thumbs up for this
thank you asus for launching this smartphone .
this smartphone is a real beast and killer of redmi note 5pro.it &apos;s battery is like an inverter and display is ausome .
but it &apos;s lack eis and slow motion video recording .
i hope that asus will fix it soon .
it is the best smartphone under rupees 20,000range .
good budget phone. happy to buy it .
lots of noise in night
2. not much details in photo
camera bokeh effect / depth effect not working properly
4. selfie camera is too much noisy .
awesome phone don &apos;t think about anything while buying this phone it &apos;s a beast and true rn 5 pro killer
and also grey color is better than black one it is more premium
now i am a fan of asus .
excellent device trust me
you will definitely fall in love with the device .
simply wonderful , go for it .
this divoce camera is very bed but bettery good
very good phone in this range .
this is my second asus phone .
camera app sucks rest everything works .
6 gb ram model has yellow shade display i am not confirmed if it is hardware or software problem .
after editing photos taken by this phone i am amazed .
still lack of image stability ( eis )
and crappy camera app .
battery life can also be improved by update but right now battery have some drain issues on ideal mode .
camera performance is good .
i hope upcoming updates will make this phone a beast than other mobiles under 20k .
overall excellent , asus brand is awesome .
a major upgrade in camera compared to previous variants of zenfone max pro m1 .
overall i am happy with this phone .
it suits all my requirements .
if you need huge battery and good performance and normal camera , this 6gb variant of asus zenfone max pro m1 is the phone for you .
i mean i &apos;m love with this phone .
i had bought 4 gb variant 3 months ago and it was working splendid in all aspects .
and now it &apos;s 6gb one .
max pro is very good in day to day use .
it has got great battery life .
the software is butter smooth .
camera is decent and in fact captures more details that its competitors , particularly redmi note 5 pro .
it is highly recommended to buy this phone
so far it &apos;s going amazing battery is nice but can be improved by updates .
no lag noticed except for instagram and sometimes play store which might be a software issue .
camera is awesome except front it &apos;s neither excellent nor bad .
just need a little bit of software improvements ( for camera , battery , and instagram ) except for that this is totally a value for money device .
if you &apos;re thinking to buy just go for it .
6gb variant is basically best smartphone in 15k price .
except the camera performance it can beat rn5 pro in every aspect .
there will be slight difference in camera , not recognisable until compared side-by-side .
it &apos;s really a vfm smartphone , i was planning to go for mi a2 but they blew up this time .
no one is offering 6gb of ram at this price point though you have to compromise a bit with the camera but i guess they &apos;ll make it more better with updates .
edit : - i &apos;ve been using this phone for a week now , mostly i &apos;ve been greeted with bugs which are irritating like some apps dont work over the wifi connection and work just fine over 3g / 4g .
first of all i would like to say that this is the best smartphone you will ever get under ₹ 15k price range .
i would point out the pros and cons of this phone after use of 10 days .
there is massive improvement in the camera quality .
16mp front and 16 + 5mp back camera is really an icing on the cake .
picture quality is crisp and detailed .
beat smart phone under budget .
flipkart delivery service is awesome .
everything great except a low performing camera infront of redmi note 5 pro .
hope camera can be improved by software update .
hai guys , my name is jeevan from kharagpur .
this one is a nice product i m not rating as a awesome product because of camera it capture nice images but not up to the mark which was given by company ( means 16 mp ) .
value for money proudect
review after 3 days no error for camera
purchaseed 6 gb variant
just few days after using this phone man this battery is crazy 10 hours of screen on time it is insane .
6 gb ram optimization is really good
camera was problem with other two varients but that &apos;s not the case with 6 gb model
and most important stock android making phone smooth .
camera app needs to be replaced with asus pixelmaster camera app and camera2api should be enabled by software update .
because camera hardware much more capable than redmi note 5 pro .
if you peeps know how to enable camera2api without unlocking bootloader , then install google camera mod by arnova , just search on internet for everything .
display , battery backup and camera are value for money and 100 % satisfactory .
the product looks good .
i have done a full charging and checked .
i was able to use for around 30 hours , out of which around 5 hours hotspot was on .
have pretty decent backup
looks are good and it fits in your hand because of good shape .
camera is ok , not so great .
normal pics are ok .
i tried to take shot similar to macro , very difficult to get focus .
sound is loud , but no so clear if we put on speaker when talking .
performance is good and net is working very fast .
no direct video calling option. camera is not that good , ui bugs .
the phone works fine : )
one word . awesome
great phone with great specs .
and also a better than resonable price tag .
best phone i got it at 13700 thank flipkart for this offer and phone as well. good go asus
ram management is good but camera is not good
super phone , battery is amazing
best budget stock android mobile
superb phone , should buy for 15k
great camera and display
excellent mobile brilliant performance
mobile beast ️ 🧡
no.1 mobile at this price range &quot; unbeatable &quot;
eis also working , it is in hidden camera settings
hai guys from asus 6gb.everything is ok but in camera i am disappointed by asus . , may be they can solve the issues new updates.i am waiting for that . , other things no words to say everything awesome .
no one can beat this phone in its range
good phone in this price
awesome phone value for money good
only camera is a lil weak rest everything else is very good
if asus updates camera software then i will rate this device 5 star
camera is little bit better and fingerprint sensor is 2x faster than 4gb version. can run pubg at high settings and high fps .
headphone jack is at the bottom n usb port is upside down which is wierd !
update 1 : free tpu back cover got yellowish after 3 days of use . ( as all transparent tpu covers )
perfect fit. and if you want to remove bubble from the side use oil method .
best phone in this range
good quality mobile but need some updates like camera
great performance , no doubt .
but only issue camera in low light .
here is my critical view of the device
battery dropped from 89 % to 61 % in 16 hours , overall good battery but it will give you feel of 4000mah battery only .
superb handset can &apos;t say anything. just awesome . worth of money
just go for it. flipkart will serve it. asus will care for it .
nice product and love the flipkart fast delivery
the best camera phone , the best battery , best display , best processor , best ram , best speed , all in one best smartphone .
it &apos;s really gud product. bt in camera n face unlock want to improve , i thinck asus work to improve it &apos;s , overview mobile is really awesome
best mobile in budget .
don &apos;t go to other mobile .
best budget phone for 15k .
performance is the highlight of this phone .
phone &apos;s battery lasts for 2 days on normal use with data / wifi all the time .
gesture modes and face unlock are hit / miss .
only drawback is camera app in this phone is not good .
asus should enable camera2 api for this phone over ota update .
first of all i would like to say thanks to flipkart for the fastest delivery !
at this price range this is one of the best mobile .
there are many ways of unlocking the device !
camera and battery are excellent
if you are a gamer. especially if you are a pubg gamer this mobile totally fits in !
if you are about the buy the mobile and you are confused with the which color to buy. go for grey , cuz it looks premium
nice mobile , increase our dignity
awesome phone but bugs hay
the phone is an ultimate beast as said by asus , it decrowned xiaomi redmi note 5 pro and became a flagship .
the phone leads ahead in every aspect .
camera : the camera is too good as compared to 3 gb and 4gb
though rn5 pro leads in this segment a
little bit , but it is acceptable because asus gives
things which are too good than rn5 pro .
best value for money smartphone under 15000 .
specially the display , battery and performance. and stock android experience is the bonus. it really doesn &apos;t feel that it has a 5000 mah battery .
front camera not good
most affordable 6gb ram phone with stock android experience and 8.1 out of the box .
asus just need to update its camera and give eis by fota .
hope to see usb-type c next year in m2 .
asus just nailed it with this version , the experience is as smooth as it gets , the 6gb ram shows it &apos;s strength , when there its multi window heavy games etc etc it &apos;s smooth experience tholrough out .
a little detail version .
1. camera : - okay not it &apos;s biggest selling point but they easily deliver and they tend to go for natural colors thus may not be pretty to eyes but are a real deal
built : - it &apos;s built is quite sturdy and network reception is great
attractive , ram is enough , battery enough , speaker sound as well as , display size is very good , but , no amoled screen , no gorilla glass , network systems not strong , also hang problem is seen just like sumsang mobile .
nice product for 15000 thousand the delivery of product is fast i have got it in two days i satisfied from that product
ovar all phone is good but internet speed problem in the phone
really awesome product gonna be tough competitive phone for redmi 5 pro camera , display , battery , speed etc . , all r very nice worth and cheap for this product .
phone is not ringing during incoming call , can someone from asus please help on this
loving it asus. thank you .
nice ph at this price segment .
camera like oppo vivo . u can click a pic without makeup
best budget smartphone of 2018 in rs .
with wonderful performance , camera , battery life and screen .
it &apos;s more than value for money .
battery is best in this range
camera is best in this range
processor snapdragon 636 is tremendous
the best thing is stock like android interface
worth for money 6gb and dedication memory card slot
great device , best under 15k .
screen quality is best of best it has ips display but the colours are vibrant .
it has very good quality of ips display like lg phone not cheap quality ips display on xiaomi &apos;s all phone .
camera is good , battery is long lasting , it has notification led , sounds quality is good , ram and proccessor is fast .
i love this phone and i guarantee you will never regret after buying this phone
superb phone. value for money
nice phone under 15k
awesome phone , super fast , no heating at all , performance superb and battery long time .
only little bit heat while charging and watching youtube videos using 4g sim net and it is common .
1 battery backup is awesome
3 display is amazing
4 camera is decent not too good not too bad
5 u can play pubg in high def
1 no gorilla glass
• since it has 5000 mah battery , normal users can use this phone up to 4 days , whereas internet users can use the phone upto 2 days .
• 16 + 5 mp dual camera at backside is good and 16mp front camera does takes good selfies .
• due to qualcomm snapdragon 636 and 6gb ram , playing video is awesome and there is no lagging while playing games .
• sound quality is excellent .
if you want more sound , one can use max-box provided with this mobile .
• mobile has 3 slots .
far better than redmi note 5 pro
no words for this awesome device .
best phone best ram 6 gb it better for gaming
i think asus zenfone max pro m1 is better than redmi note 5pro
1 ) price is also upto mark ( redmi 4 gb ram available at this price )
2 ) simple user interface any one can operate this mobile
3 ) no heating issue after heavy usage of 2 days .
4 ) 5000mah power is more than enough
overall good impression by asus
phone is good , camera not best for low light .but not capchar bad photo , dey photo is natural and good qualiy .
overall very good quality phone , . at . 14999 / -now
the phone is just amazing .
it &apos;s the best value for money smartphone .
it feels like 20k + phone.i got the delivery in just 23hours which is just amazing .
whoever cannot buy oneplus because of cost then it &apos;s very good option .
plus the stock android is the icing on the cake.very much satisfied .
don &apos;t regret just go for it you will love this phone .
not satisfied with front camera still
firstly i should be thankful to ekart logistics to deliver my zenfone max pro m1 within 24hours .
yesterday 12 : 00pm i ordered asus zenfone max pro m1 and today 12 : 30pm it was in my hand .
there is no gorilla glass in zenfone but after all it is really unbeatable .
first time i brought asus product ( zenfone m1 6gb ) phone it &apos;s really awesome to use this device .
it is extremely powerful sd processor and battery is very useful in every condition .
good job asus team .
best phone under 20k i think
first of all thank you flipkart for fast delivery
dual camera is awesome
good battery back up
very fast with 6gb ram
last of all just go for it if you wanna buy a budget phone
very good phone without any doubts .
camera is good but night photography is ok
call clarity is very good
iam using iphone 7 plus but my zen beats all
the best mobile phone for rs15000 .
thanks to flipkart executive who came twice and delivered before time .
1st of all asus and flipkart well done
camera is also good bt after few updates
grey looks better , guyz if ur confused between both clous , dont be , grey is better then black
over all product is too much good
wonderful phone , 200 % value for money
what else one can expect in 15k ?
the beast , in real manner. go for it .
really unbeatable mobile in this category. sabka baap asus zenfone max pro. amazing
this is one of the best phone under this price segment .
under 15k you are getting very nice display , 5000 mah battery , triple sim slots , 6gb ram snapdragon 636 .
camera is also good but need some improvement which can be fixed via ota update so dont worry .
no company will give you this type of extraordinary specs under 15000rs .
phone display , performance and battery backup is beyond your expectations .
camera is also fine .
close your eyes and buy it .
you will not get regret .
worry free go for it .
6 gb ram 64 rom
16 mp front cam .
in this price range .
got in first sale .
at first place , i was convinced of not to buy rn5p as the price shot up after its initial sale and it was just an artificial raise because of its demand and not worth of it .
at the time i was waiting for a mobile in this price range , then came was this beast .
let me not go into the review of specifications as many had hit the right chords .
if you are looking for a quality mobile which values your every penny then close your eyes and go grab one at once .
phone is just awesome .
camera is good batter backup is just amazing i charged it 100 % at 11am and next day its 12 : 13pm still battery is 40 % .
camera is also good but after updating system update , pic have lot of noice. look is just awesome and superlight weigh compare to mi note 5 pro. and it is way way better than note
battery backup is good .
face unlock is satisfactory
great hardware let down by awful buggy software implementation .
only saving grace is the awesome developer support on xda which ensures you don &apos;t depend on asus for the right software .
go for it only if you are the adventures type and ready to flash custom roms to unlock the full potential .
amazing product in affordable price .
i loved the battery life as it &apos;s been working smoothly since last 3 days .
thanks for on time delivery .
non asus users try to give a sort .
this phone is almost perfect .
looks great in the grey color .
performance is also awesome .
battery life is insane .
cameras are also very good .
only the camera app needs to be improved .
everything else is just perfect .
its awesome in gaming and also its very good and long lasting battery
very nice mobile , clear and sharp display , best camera , loud sound , good battery backup. asus done its job .
thanks to flipkart and ekart service delivered mobile in time .
amazing at what you get at this price .
the phone is really good and has a lot to offer .
the best part is that it has dual 4g slots , which means you can use your volte calling even if you are using data services on a non volte sim card .
thanx to flipkart for the fastest delivery .
also thanx to asus for this great mobile manufacturing .
i am just talking about the cons .
front camera is not super but good , need many improvements .
rear camera is not up to the mark , it needs more and more improvement.the low light photos capturing is very bad .
so please asus if you are going through my review , please fix the camera problem through ota update sooner .
i got the product one day prior to flipkart commitment .
asus zenfone max pro m1 is a real show stealer with mind blowing performance .
damm. this is the note 5 pro killer
ok the phone is great at this point .
i &apos;m loving the almost stock android feel .
the camera actually takes the natural side of you .
it maybe not suitable as per their comfort for some people , but people like me definitely loves the phone .
but it crashes most of the time .
also need to know that it has no eis which means the stabilizer while shooting a video .
it can be fixed with an update if asus see through it .
when compared with 3 gb or 4gb ram model the cameras of 6gb model is much better
a beast phone in this price range .
obviously without a doubt a note 5 pro killer .
go for without a second thought .
asus zenfone max pro m1. firstly gratitude to flipkart and their deliver partner ekart for delivering the device before stipulated time .
coming over to device , the looks and feel of device is exemplary and premium in its class .
with the sillicon case in box in 6 gb variantthe smudging at back becomes a non issue .
the display quality too is fantastic and awesome reproduction of sound through its 5 magnet speaker .
phone is overall good but camera is not meet expectation
best phone in 15k .
i am using redmi note 5 pro. but fully satisfied with asus &apos;s performance .
camera is at par with redmi. other features are far better .
like u get massive 5000 mah battery . 6gb ram in same price .
dedicated memory card slot . 6gb ram . 5000 mah .
battery makes it better to note 5 pro in same price .
its a better choice in 15k .
awesome battery backup , i have charged it yesterday till now i have 58 % left .
if you are looking for a smart phone at 15000 budget. simply go for it .
i m using this from past2days .
it &apos;s screen sensitivity is awesome.even a single dust particle slips when it come into contact with screen .
boy o boy this is one heck of a phone u should go blindly for. believe me u won &apos;t regret it
1.best phone for this money value .
2.as 16 + 5 mp rear camera , average result .
3.16 mp selfi camera is best .
5.i have tried two jio sims at a time .
6.fingerprint sensor is slightly slow , but it can be developed after updates .
7.speaker volume is slightly low , but booster box works very well .
- video call is not supporting. needs an update
there are low inbuilt features , i was expecting more and user friendly features but asus disappointed me .
not very happy using it .
the performance of the phone is awesome .
the phone is fast charging .
camera is good in day light .
clear and large sound ( u don &apos;t need a speaker ) .
earphones not given in the box .
camera works average in low light conditions .
nice phone and good camera
awesome mobile. go for it without a second thought , you won &apos;t regret
simply amazing for a cheap price .
the camera looked bad but after the update it was good.there is no option for direct screen short .
the battery is good might last for 1 and a half days .
good performance no stucking but only 50 gb internal out of 64 gb
light weight phone for a big battery
great phone enjoying to fullest
i have not face any lag in fingerprint sensor. and even camera is better than vivo v9
superb phone at this price range .
nice phone to replace note 5 pro
every thing is good battery screen os and etc .
with 2.4ghz 1 antenna the rate is limited to 72 max 86 , so even 50 + is not possible .
thats only -ve they should have included the 5gac chip in 6gb apart from other changes .
eis may be available in future update .
for hdr is so slow cant capture the needed photo .
a good purchase , great performance , descent screen , a good camera hardware in 15k price range .
stock camera gives good images in good lighting conditation .
in low light situation use old one plus camera app ( no root ) .
then total problem will solve .
sound quality also descent.i am very happy with my purchase .
awesome camera ( but lacking of eis , only for video recording ) , nice battery , good stock android experience ( oreo ) , audio quality is just fabulous , premium look , fhd + display , that &apos;s enough for rs 15000 🤗 🤗 🤗
i really got tired of these xiaomis. what a great phone. really user friendly interface and silky smooth operation .
loved the phone received it before the mentioned date great service by flipkart would give a more detailed review later
phone is very very superrrrr
best phone under rs 15000
face unlock doesn &apos;t work
great mobile with extraordinary features .
unbeatable in this price segment
value for money smartphone , 6gb ram , 5000mah battery , snapdragon 636 , good cameras , redmi note 5 pro killer phone .

wowww this mobile just blews ur mind .
battery running status very well

just go for it. awesome phone. but , 1. camera is very poor and needs to be upgraded immediately , and 2. slow motion video recording and time lapse needs to be included via update.please asus do it . , .

lucky to book and get delivery in two days during first flash sale .
got delivery on 28th july .
not getting hot during charging .
worth to buy for 15,000 / - rs .
the main problem is that i don &apos;t have a perfect temporary screen card for this asus zenfone max pro m1
the phone is amazing but the camera could been have better. but the overall performance of the phone is just amazing. and the best part is the stock android seems like it &apos;s google pixel
this phone can beat mi
great value for money .
6gb varient has decent cameras !
face unlock and fingerprint works really well !
good for gaming !
almost no heating even when playing games like pubg for extended periods !
good morning nice looking
audio quality through 3.5mm jack is poor
one of the amaging mobile at this cost i &apos;m really impressed with its performance
battery draining too fast. it feels like i am using 3000-4000mah battery. overall it is best phone under 15k. but battery performance dissappointed me .
very good mobile under 20k .
need some improvements on face unlock features .
awesome mobile. bt fingerprint sensor slow .
and battery life not good. normal use one day lasting. and play game , play video , etc used then 18 / 19 hours .
but other features good .
i love this mobile. nice. love it .
nice looking and light weight
battery and 6gb ram more advantage
perfect smartphone for the price .
great hardware , average software ( ota updates / other cam apps will do wonders ) 4k videos .
superb quality and design .
beastly internals - sd636 , 6gb ddr4 , 64 gb , dedicated sd card slot , dual volte sim slots , pleasant ips display etc etc .
maxbox is a cool accessory .
received 2 ota updates already .
no qc certified fast charging .
sooperb phone. i am big fan of asus. thank you flipcart for your fastest delivery. hope you next budjet phone very soon .
dont buy if you are camera enthusiastic , camera is the place where this phone will be requiring a good update , hope asus will provide camera update in future otherwise a good value for money
camera not up to mark , overall value for money
the phone is fast always has around 3gb ram free.camera has improved a lot compared to 4gb version .
camera &apos;s good.no heating issue till now.display is good as well.sd 636 is fastest in segment .
best at its class .
one of the greatest phone in his budget segment .
battery backup best fast to operate almost fabulous smart phone
the phone feels premium in your hands .
the pure android experience makes sure everything runs smoothly .
the humongous battery gives you ample screen on time and the camera takes greats shots with ample detail .
the sub-15k price makes it a great value for money device , provided it has the best mid-range processor available right now .
i would recommend it to everyone who &apos;s looking for a great device under 20k .
as per my point of view its a best mobile in this price .
asus were done really nice work on their product .
i have grey colour model of 6 gb ram , and really satisfied my all expectations .
phone is awesome 5000mah battery performance is awesome if compare to other handset .
fingerprint scanner far better than 3,4 gb variant .
speaker sound is enough for mobile it &apos;s provides nice and clear sound .
build quality is quite impressive .
camera quality is good i think that company get software update to provide eis .
overall not any complaint for camera .
if anyone think about buy then must go for it .
killer for all other smart phones .
everyone can buy with closing eye
received my phone within 2 days even though the estimate was 5-6 days .
so , kudos flipkart for the delivery .
and i &apos;ve spent over 5 hrs with the phone now .
good first impressions till now .
first impressions : great performance ; average camera , especially low light and portrait .
not as good as the rn5p imo .
but i already expected this .
user experience is fluid .
battery life seems very good .
played pubg on high graphics settings .

good finishing , bright screen , good batter back up and horrible camera , pictures are very average selfie is ok bt rear camera is really horrible experience

just too good at this price point .
only disappointment is no gorilla glass protection no ear phone also .
nice product by asus .
provide battery manager app like other asus phone .
best mobile under 15000 .face unlocking slow process , and during download performance process is slow.battery backup average
just go for it and use a temperd glass
thanks flipkart for 2 days delivery
overall i found device value for money under 15 k
but on the very first day of mobile i faced some serious issues like : -
1. low accuracy of face unlock
2. after using it continuously for 4 hours i found some heating issues
i feel even after updating the camera on hardware level some serious improvements need to be done on software through ota update .
camera needs to be improved .
6gb ram . 636 snapdragon . 5000 mah battery. both sim card slots supports 4g
can &apos;t get better then this .
every phone has problems .
the problems listed for this phone can be ignored
awesome phone at this range
wow asus max pro m1 is awesome and it &apos;s a beast spectacular phone in this price range buy this and it won &apos;t disappoint
in this price segment it is the best product
gaming was awesome with no lag , no heating issues ( played asphalt 8 for half an hour continuously ) , better battery
fast delivery by flipkart in 17 hours
best phone under 15 k .
thunder fast delivery thanks flipkart
i am using lg g6 and brought this for my mom .
since she uses phone very less , searched for a non-chinese brand and zeroed on this .
observations as of now :
selfie camera is excellent .
battery as of now is good .
fingerprint censor works faster than my lg g6 .
same is the case with selfie camera .
i &apos;ll update after using it for few days .
ps : asus is from taiwan ( republic of china ) which is not mainland china .
go for it guys
good performance. value for money. asus need to ship with screen protector. because there is no gorilla glass .
awesome smartphone and flipkart service is excellent .
thanks to flipkart for fast delivery , keep it up .
worth with money and very good product .
some issue with the phone. it &apos;s taking 8 hrs to full charge. and asus has not come up with any solution .
think before you buy this phone .
a value for money handset .
improved camera in this 6gb version .
it was delivered on next day !
fast delivery by flipkart .
camera is also decent unlike said by earlier reviewers .
nobody mentioned about availability of zenmotion .
though it is a stock android they have given zenmotion which is great thing .
battery is best , nothing to say about it .
it &apos;s best phone in 15k , just go for it .
there are some bugs which are still in the phone such as it is not zooming in in rear camera portrait mode .
amazing phn in this range .
great camera , visual quality , battery backup .
i m loving it
thanks flipkart for fast delivery of my product phone is great but camera interface is hawkward pls improve camera for further updates
worth of money pam quality
owsome service. delivery boy quick service. thank you flipkart and asus company .
with below 15k it is the best mobile @ this time
but camera on # portrait # mode pic back side nothing will change also on hdr mode pic capturing will getting sometimes blurrr .
super stylish look , and body , super cam , battery
best mobile under 15000 / -
really good , value for money .
reasonably fast charging when compared to older mobiles .
speed is very good .
really really very good with this price band .
good mobile but in my phone portrait is not working
value for money phone .
awesome mobile value for money
grey colour is better than black
less than 24 hours delivery
very bad phone poor display quality irritating software completely dissatisfied
phone is nice. hardware is good but software needs to be upgraded. no live wallpaper supported. cant save profile pic on whatsapp using camera that time in normal mode. no eis no slomo no time lapse .
face beauty not working well. but it all works when u apply other camera apps .
bed camera nothing to buy and not refund and not exchange to other new phone
no extra blots which means only required apps are inbuilt
probably no other brand can compete this price especially for 6gb variant .
the mobile is too heavy and its aspect ratio makes it look longer ( less wide ) .
i have seen other 6.3 inch mobile which is much smaller in size and light weight .
un-necessary the mobile body has been made too big than the screen .
horrible decision of my life. mobile gets switched off automatically . don &apos;t waste your money
not bad for gamer who does not mind about the camera in low light photography
awesome mobile i loved it
also when i tried video recording no matter whether it was hd or in 4k it was not clear .
very low quality product hanging problem display blinking problem very slow charging
phone is full value for money but battery drains little faster without playing any games.like its a 3000 mah not a 5000 mah .
except that the phone is awesome .
sim removal pin socket is not inside the box . ( missing from ekart courier or flipkart ) .
waste of money. better to buy redmi note 5 pro .
first time brightness problem and second replacement in battery quick low problem
main problem in this set is camera , i have tried 2 different variant , in both while clicking , photos will be bright , but within 2 seconds , suddenly brightness will come down .
in gallery , if you open photo the same thing happens .
about battery performance , for 5000 mah , it should not performing as expected .
my oppo f3 4000 mah battery backup was performing nice than this .
i can say medium set , not that much good mobile .
considering the price of 14999 this phone is a massive value for money .
sd636 , 5000mah battery , pretty decent display and near stock android experience ( not to be confused with androidone ) is a pretty good package at this price point .
if at any point one can get this device for a lower price tag , then it &apos;s a great benefit for the user .
it claims it has 4k recording .
but it is not there .
you can &apos;t create secondary account of android .
which asus india says , it is on purpose .
they can &apos;t see its purpose .
they think they are brilliant than android developers .
unknowingly it is going into silent mode .
because of that i &apos;m missing lot of calls and i need to review calls every time .
updated software updates multiple times but issue not resolved yet .
front camera is 16mp but it is just number .
in low light conditions camera is very bad .
but back camera working superb .
but this phone second slim slot doesn &apos;t catch signals .
some times battery drained out .
but this price range this phone very aggressive .
charging very quickly 5000 mah just 150 minutes .
it &apos;s very big in my hands .
face unlock slower than usual .
finger print sensor working fine .
sound quality is amazing .
but there is no equaliser .
so you can download third-party apps .
the best phone you can get in 15k .
don &apos;t get confused in bad reviews .
except probably for its thickness , weight and camera quality which is not that great , the phone is reasonably good .
but these oddities have been well compensated by its jaw dropping price .
i bought it for its 6gb ram and its battery life which is perfectly okay .
for this price , you can &apos;t have an apple , so by and large i &apos;m satisfied .
always giving damage phone .
good mobile with good features but no good options
good camera , battery and sound
camera is very poor .
asus need to release a software update for it .
great phone this price
this phone has plain android os with no third party apps .
it even does not have gallery or photo editing tools .
asus should work in improving camera app and editing tools
excellent user interface.quicker finger print response.unbeatable battery back up.good camera.mainly even after extensive use the phone is not heating better than red me note 5pro.the only con if you count is it &apos;s speaker
well , i would not like to exaggerate but before i proceed on to pros and cons , here are my first impressions !
flipkart- simply amazing , they delivered my order in nbd w / o any extra charge ( other website charge ~ rs100 )
i have used only branded mobiles earlier , note ii being the last flagship used by me .
what a screen resolution- simply wow .
i felt am using a super amoled at first .
i &apos;m what you can call a power user to the extent that i i use a lot of apps and open over 100 + tabs ( with 10-20 active ones ) in the browser frequently .
i am getting over 12 hours screen on time ( without fb / insta / messenger or any games ) .
installed about 300 + apps with little local music / online radio / youtube activity .
my feeling is , automatic screen brightness could &apos;ve been a bit more reactive .
loudspeaker noise during calls feels a bit fuzzy .
great performer and battery beast for the price. but
camera not good as expected , as an upgrade .
hope that asus fixes this with ota updates .
no display protection , at least asus could have given a screen guard instead of maxbox .
no fast charging support , but manageable with charger provided .
verdict- asus has managed to give a value for money device. thanks asus and flipkart. my rating 8.5 / 10 .
it capture natural and realistic photos unlike others who will make you fair and soften your face .
display is great but i wish it had gorilla glass but yet its great .
got the phone delivered before the time .
this phone is worth the money
good product and value for money. delivered a day before .
nice phone with nice display
but small small bugs to be fixed .
for example , in front camera flash is not enabled , no font style change settings , no gestures and little bit more customization is needed for average users .
and one thing there is no gallery
no clearity of camera , it is like 3 mp not 16mp
vanilla android 8.1 is bad .
better to buy mi redmi note 5 pro .
since flipkart won &apos;t allow me to get a refund on this product i am thinking of selling it out just after using for 1day .
after using this phone for 12days , this is the worst phone for 15000 rupees .
camera app has a very bad ui .
quality of pics is bad .
the back panel of the phone near the charging jack is bulging out and on pressing it there is a sound of click-click .
this phone is very chip quality i got the phone on 2 nd november but after 15 days the phone is hang software problem and abnormal deth screen problem plz guys don &apos;t buy this phone .
i bought this phone on november 2018 end and feb 2019 2 times in service center .
flipkart service is good on time time product delivery .
donot buy this product , this phone have internet speed issue , voice not comes clear from other side .
i took latest 6 gb ram , but phone is very slow .
so my recomendation about this phone .
donot buy this waste product .
display quality not good as samsung j6 .
too big cant operate in single hand .
all youtubers made paid review
camera is not good in low light condition
my honest opinion is it &apos;s not worth for 15k
very good performance , battery life is superb , portrait mode. should. be improved. some times is working correctly and sometimes not. and in display rediss-yellow shades should be minimised .
bad experience about the product .
front facing camera flash light not working
i have got it today .
when i switched on the phn has hanged .
switched on / off key not working. what can i do .
memory card not supported 128gb i &apos;m very sad
i got faulty handset it is not able to detect sim and not able to connect wifi it not showing imei number after dail
# 06 # first time from flipkart i got faulty mobile
i requested to return the mobile
if you try to return your product , flipkart will not allow to do this .
they will call you and give you some unnecessary lecture and finally they will reject your replacement .
i am totally fed up by their phone call. why will i do troubleshooting for new mobile , why will i active battery saver option when it is 5000mah battery .
they were giving me nonsense idea for a new phone .
repeatedly i share my problems but the person over phone forcing me to do troubleshooting .
this phone is complete waste as well as flipkart &apos;s service .
i ordered this phone fingerprint scanner as well as charging works according to its own mood .
i put a replacement order too .
they tried calling me and also sent a guy to check but after that m still waiting for the replacement .
battery : nice backup can play heavy games b2b
face detection : better than ok ok

review after 5 months : -
pros : - good battery life , display , no lag
cons : -mic not working properly since day 1 , no camera function , network keeps going off , though 4g but even 2g works more faster than the 4g on this mobile

5. daily 5 , 6 hours used after finger not detected when phone power restart after finger print censor working
6. when phone in shurt pocket when incoming call lift the phone in pocket call is automatic call cut every time
7. camera bad quality when zoom option
amazing product , using 6gb / 64gb variant and reviewing after 7 months of extensive usage .
amazing display ( could have been better with gorilla screen )
main camera is average ( can be better with better camera app apart from one which is there now )
selfie camera is lot better than other phones ( above average )
built is strong and durable
multi tasks runs without any issues .
no lags and hang till date .
disappointed by camera performanceb as was expecting to work it in low light by reviews here as well on youtube .
but it always tries to focus in low light and because of that i have problem taking perfect videos at evening or night .
or else this is the best mobile at best price till now .
got it for 12,000 on sale .
don &apos;t buy this phone , still on android oreo and last 6 months no update to pie and no updates bin near future , by real me instead

touch problem after using 5 month
very bad and worst experience with flipkart. often some of the programs are automatically activated like bluetooth and etc .
even we manually turn off the programs , it will again and again got turn on .
for that we have to restart the mobile phone .
then it will get reset to default .
and then sound doesn &apos;t work properly. sometimes the caller ringtone will come and many of the times the sound will not come while making call .
worst phone . touch screen not working and worst camera.within 2 months i faced so many issues this product .
phone is good but has some bugs in it asus updates are useless and unable to fix those problem for exp battery draining issue , camera blurr iffect probs
the phone is thick in size. and it is heated quickly .
better to go for redmi note 5 pro
not reliable product some trouble issues with display and flipkart not returning so finally wastage my money
i was using one plus 5t and this camera is much better than 5t .
only thing i am upset is flipkart took a month to deliver it and in the start they showed one day delivery then kept on changing delivery dates .
two day { forty six hours approx ) battery life with liberal use of 4g .
does not heat up upon 4g usage or while charging .
reasonably light weight despite massive battery .
good face unlock and finger print .
not expected level in features .
very good mobile , i purchased the the mobile under diwali offer , only con is camera is not so good , but you can download google camera , battery back up is also good , thank you flifcart for the quick delivery
problem with camera only. and sometimes the ideal battery draining is huge. otherwise performance is great
voice interruption for others
best battery life best phones speaker best ever
great phone in mid-range especially during big billion days on the great purchase .
i am not any specialist but a great phone for pocket budget .
everything is just great .
except for one thing .
the selfie is coming in mirror mode. i tried so hard but no option to fix it .
battery raja , nice performance , v good picture quality .
totally a all rounder mobile in 13000rs .
mobile looks stylish in black .
excellent camera features , satisfied with storage and ram .
it takes time to charge and battery is draining somewhat quickly , not sure it would last long .
overall worthy mobile for the acceptable price .
product not good .
replacement no way. very bad product.finger print not working .
only better think battery is good
# camera not good , immage detailing fine .
natural color in immage .
when immage open in gallery than immage open with little hanging .
# battery drained problem .
after full charge u can use mobile only 1 day like 3000 mah battery .
charging time is 2.5 to 3 hour &apos;s .
# some time bugs problem showing in application .
# contact app not good .
for vedio calling use 3rd party app .
phone display was not working after using one hour
excellent camera.looks pretty cool .
but problem with this phone is cheap quality hardware .
could have used beeter quality material .
so far i am satisfied .
camera quality is poor not up to the mark .
good awesome product i loved it battery performance was awesome , good camera , good performance . no words .
this is very bad android phone
very bad mobile camera is very poor and battery is very bad , i am not satisfied this mobile .
first of all the battery is excellent .
camera is ok and the performance of the mobile is good .
but the main thing here is lack of applock .
there is no inbuilt applock and the settings are very less unlike redmi mobiles .
that &apos;s the only thing which is disappointing and the mobile is worth buying at that cost .
having problem with camera and finger print sensor
automatically switched off and going silent
poor phone waste of money
don &apos;t but it when you buy .
you must to check all functions of the phone .
i &apos;m buy a phone and 1 yr complete mobile protection .
the phone is defective .
performance ok , display super , but canara quality loww
touch is no properly working
don &apos;t buy this mobile because day first of using i have facing huge problem .
internet is not not connected from last 18 hours .
i have changed the sim card , switch off on on , cache delet but internet is not connected .
don &apos;t waste ur money on this
bad and slow phone
don &apos;t think more . go for it . best deal in this budget. light weight , good battery , no heat issue .
i am happy to buy this phone .
pls don &apos;t buy this product , camer clarity to bad , sound is not good , all mobiles are coming with dolby , but this mobile is poor sound quality
charger was really bad 3hrs 46mins charge only 20 % increased .
few users give lots of good reviews about this product it may be true but i have said my own experience .
nice but screen quality is low
camera quality is very poor .
it &apos;s total waste of money .
i wonder how flipkart is promoting the sale of this product .
flipkart is loosing it &apos;s good name coz of such poor quality product by misleading the customers .
good to use for a long run
while calling opposite side person can hear my voice
read for full review .
first of all i thank to flipkart with such a fast delivery .

with playing games i have to charge it every days .
finger print sensor is not working fine . , and camera interface is too bad please don &apos;t wast u r money .
camera quality is very bad and many of bugs capture
asus zenfone the best phone
but slow motion video function update fast
this phone is best phone i loved it is phone
but security on application lock
good - battery , design , display and software
area for improvement - sound quality , camera quality
bad - bluetooth voice call
phone is the best phone in this range .
specially the battery life ( i don &apos;t know if it can be improved in software update ) but 5000 mah battery should be much better. and the rest is perfect
this is a bit heavy in weight comparing to others in the market .
camera doesn &apos;t support manual operations .
skin tones aren &apos;t not appropriate on front and rear lenses .
forget about ois , even eis is not integrated after 2 company &apos;s updates .
except camera quality ( in low light only ) images are full of noises while zooming .
even after 6 gb variant , it hangs .
app stops working suddenly .
some issue with turn on / off mobile data .
firstly thanks to flipkart to good delivery .
and 1 day before delivery .
phone is looking very nice fingerprint sensor is very fast i like this phone thank u asus
over all mobile is good but only ui , u need to worry about
performance wise mob is osm
but lacks in some feature
doesn &apos;t have gallery file manager autocall recording some camera issues .
fingerprint sensor is bit late n battery seems 4000mah not 5kmah is drains lil faster
smart battery life , smooth operating , camera good both rear and front , but no gorila class its missing .
sound quality with headphones is not good .
the volume is very low and cannot be increased .
asus guys please take a note of this
now no problem . excellent work
fantastic phone at this price .
i was one of the lucky people who could buy it on the day of launch .
it &apos;s almost 3 weeks now hence can now write a genuine review .
specs are simply superb .
battery backup is fantastic and no heating problem at all .
camera is very good the front camera is outstanding .
i am not into gaming but use other heavy photo and video editing tools and apps , there is no lag at all .
camera is not good and flipkart service is very bad phone can not change or return total waste money
why display yelloish , other wise perfect
worst seller. worst product. hanging problem .
display is awesome and touch response good.camera is above average.no hanging issue.sound is loud and cristal clear .
battery last for 1.5 days with average it uses with gaming no lag in gaming performance .
overall satisfied with the product .
it has good camera , excellent battery backup , excellent display and when tounch to display it &apos;s smooth felling and smooth in stock android .
if at home screen and lock screen we set wallpaper like s9 plus it look like it .
recieved my order in 1 day .
back camera is very good .
selfie camera needs some improvement .
great product by asus .
must buy if you -
does on the go editing of pics and videos
need long lasting battery
need security updates regularly
dont need good camera
camera is the only con right now. but it can be fixed with software updates . ( but dont know when )
hit like if you find this review useful .
excellent mobile camera quality superb battery backup excellent love you asus .
thank flipkart quick delivery by flipkart great work .
this is an insanely performance beast available in the market at this price .
it has a battery which will last long ( obviously as it has an 5000 mah battery )
it will provide a great experience as it is packed with stock android .
it really worth buying .
display good but can be little more attractive .
battery not upto mark as claimed by company .
over all it is worth buying .
i have used this phone from last one week .
i just buy it supper delivery
it &apos;s really good phone i am really happy
after few months i will write another review
after 15 days i updated few pic of back camera
camera is very good but basic .
pro mode should be added .
image capture with fingerprint scanner should be added .
face detection is moody .
os is extremely basic and not much room for customisation .
phone is good but there is no type c port and no fast charging support .
they claim fast charge charging but there no any fast charger in box charger output is 5v 2a .
which is not a fast charger
atleast they should give 18 w charger .
size can be reduce .
it is not operate by single hand .
there is box for audio amplifie which is useless they should give earphone instead that box .
camera not have any eis or ois for video stabilization .
otherwise battery capacity is super
tolaly value for money .
6 gb of ram in this price is superb .
although other features is also out of the box .

best vfm phone at the moment
first of all thanks to flipkart for fast delivery. i got product with in 24 hour &apos;s .
i would say that this is the best phone under 15k . camera battery display . ram mangament. everything is superb. if you have a budget of 15k than you can go for it without anydoubt . .
but only one thing i was expecting that bezel would be small .
apart from that phone is awesome .
no on going call recorder support , 2. no duel app option .
3. no internet speep meter 4 .
if your camera lover so sorry guys check out other device but over all its a great phone but ignore camera .

4 ) spot colour feature in camera for photography
7 ) no screen guard like gorilla guard etc .
13 ) dual band wifi so no 5ghz support .

all good but heating issue while charging , both adapter and handset get over heated .
if using more than 3-4 apps together got lag , display got lag for more than min
also tried for replacement but flipkart technical support is very bad .
some issues doesn &apos;t occur during their technical visit but on other time it occurs .
as my replacement issue is rejected .
this is terrific , bad flipkart support team .
camera result is poor .
battery although it is 5000 mah draining very fast .
you can not run internet of sim 2 .
no gallary , you have to download from playstore .
no auto brightness adjustment .
honor 9 lite is much much better .
i am suffered end user of this product , pathetic performance , since 3yrs i m a loyal customer of asus , this is my third asus handset and trust me i feel pity about myself for being brand loyalty .
even after having 6gb of ram performance is too poor , hanging problem , touchpad issue , poor battery quality , poor sound quality and over all this is lost making deal .
don &apos;t buy this product or else ur money will be wasted as if me .
even with 6 gb of ram this phone hangs a lot .
it creates problem in direct video calling through jio sim .
after an update , now i can &apos;t do video calling .
only battery is ok and other than that everything is pathetic.u will regret after taking it .
receiving network very slowly , touch is poor , clarity no , money waste , flipkart purchase this time i am fool , 10 days return policy to extend
only stock version. some common features are not available. i am not satisfy by this product. only goolge app are available .
dont buy it unless u play pubg on wifi .
number of network issues. network related problem will not be over .
i exchanged and still the problem persisted .
dont buy if you play pubg on 3g / 4g. heed my advice .
if u r buying this to play pubg
major disappointing is the zenphone os .
the phone could have been made more user friendly by giving out more options but zenphone os have been made limited access to such modes .
otherwise phone is just okay .
zenfone max pro m1 was a nice fone .
i dont know about the others , but what i am going to tell is my experience. after the last 2 updates the performance of the phone is average .
am using a 6gb vairant model .
1. battery drains little bit faster. almost 1 day ( m not a gamer )
2. after capturing the image processsing is very slow
3. sometimes facing some overall lagging issues .
4. i think i should have gone for redmi note 5 pro. believe me guys redmi is better than zenfone max pro m1
super phone nice more nice camera than redmi
super battery super processor amazing phone and nice and faaadu look
battery last for 16 hour with what &apos;s up .
mobile use to get hanged up some time .
as this is 6 gb ram but equal to 4gb ram of samsung mobile
battery ( without net 5 days / normal use 3.5 days / heavy use 2 days ) 10 / 10
front and back camera 9 / 10 and 6 / 10
display ( no gorilla glass ) 9 / 10
value for money 9.8 / 10
i am not satisfied with the product .
fingerprint sensor is not working properly and automatically my cellphone get in vibration mode when i connect my headphones with it. face unlock is not working properly .
i am really dissatisfied with the product which i purchased from flipkart .
this set is very very very bad condition display problem
phone very bad this phone just like 2gb ram workinh
i have a problem in finger lock.some time it &apos;s no work .
i am really sorry to say this , but my asus has a lot of issues .
be it software glitch or headphone issue .
very bad phone by asus battery drain problem network problem camera is very bad all things in this phone is bad
phone is good but face lock not working for low lighting
some apps not supported full fledged
tech visit person they don &apos;t know the mobile knowledge , flipkart is very bad , they supporting to seller side
wow asm. battery life 3days backup. then pure stock android . 6gb ram performance. asm then plz improve cam quality
got 2 android security updates from google on day 1 itself .
have been using other 3gb ram phones till now nd waited a long time for the 6gb variant for this phone .
well 6gb ram is very well managed .
most significant difference is how fast the phone boots up , heavy app starting time and also app installation time after downloading is in milliseconds .
i have really disappeared to buy this phone because it &apos;s name asus zenfone max pro m1 but there have no zen ui don &apos;t buy this phone
very very worst product products .
asus is worst brand i never seen any product like this. worst product and worst customer support .
one month ago i purchansed it .
it fall down on a sand sand ground slowly it was broken full touch screen .
worst worst worst product .
please don &apos;t buy this mobile this was worst product , i am use this mobile only 5 days camera failed , mobile auto switch off and hang , and now network not seen on this mobile
just replaced my ex phone xiaomi note 4 with asus zenfone 6gb 64 gb version. not impressed .
very simple feature in comparison to note 4 .
1. active notice cancellation feature is not there . you will feel as the other person is standing in a factory while using bluetooth in car .
2. no own operating system by asus .
for each and every basic function you need third party app that are usually full of advertisements .
3. very poor camera .
5. audio jack problem .
the returnt request cancelled to flipkart.the product back side lable is very old .
i think may be used product .
everything is good but coming to the screen it is very poor for ntg reason it was broken and there is no replacement for this even in ten days also
it is not performing as 6 gb ram .
please don &apos;t purchase this phone , l .
camera of this phone is also not good .
i &apos;m writing this review after nearly 10 days of usage .
nice price but not a nice device .
i am facing network related issues with jio sim , this phone struggles to get signal whare moto c + can get full signal .
facing issues with unlock .
when this device is little bit hot , then the fingerprint scanner is struggling to sence fingerprint .
if you have sweaty palms , then you will definitely hesitate with the performance of fingerprint scanner .
face unlock is not at all impressive .
fingerprint sensor is not effection .
it took atleast 1 second to unlock phone and sometime it doesnot work too .
don &apos;t buy this product. no security patches updated and worst ever smartphones phone
highly recommended. if u want to waste ur hard earned money so think twice before purchase .
only one fault is on the box they mentioning that it contains head phones but they did not given
not upto the mark as expected
compare to mi phones very less user friendly but overall performance and software / hardware are excellent .
i &apos;m using this 6gb variant for 3 days and writing the review .
battery capacity - 5000mah
stunning vibrant display and 2.5d contour glass
stock android and great performance due to qualcomm snapdragon 636 processor
rear camera is good .
camera quality is not upto the mark .
front camera is very poor .
front camera is equivalent to 8mp not 16mp
battery performance is poor .
i rarely use internet but it &apos;s not upto the mark .
there are many problems in phone fornt camera flash not working pdf not supported no ear plugs and the music box is just a cartoon box which only use a sensor to connect phone not enhancing volume
very worst phone i have seen .
no value for money .
no wall papers , no themes , i &apos;m using jio from 2 years .
the speed was so good .
after putting the sim in this phone speed reduced 100kbps max .
no galary , no themes no wall papers , no vivid display no slow motion video recording .
maximum things are not available .
very much heating issue , hangs up quickly for basic operation it is hanging .
battery also not so much good .
for normal use it drains in 20 hrs .
but when i face a problem at the beginning and negotiate with the flipkart customer care service . , immediately they reject the return request of this product .
it is the proof of a bad behavior , treachery , mean etc .
you goon.this comment is not for product but for flipkart &apos;s treacherous behavior .
the phone i receive is quite good and the other services are also vey excellent .
phone is hanging for pubg and asphalt i
once you put phone to vibration and then back to ringer , it stays in vibration mode ( though ringer is set to max ) and therefore ringtone or notification sound is not heard which is crucial for incoming calls and notifications .
i frequently put phone to vibration in office hours and this bug is freaking me out .
think twice before you buy this phone .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with the camera while recording the phone gets lag didn &apos;t expected after having 6gb ram and snapdragon 636 processor the phone will get hanged no ies till now .
i hope it will get better after update till now disappointed with asus .
product is excellent but delivery is worst and worst .
super fast delivery with in 24 hours , product is ok but not up to the mark , build quality is worst
i got the handset within 48hrs .
but the problem is with accessories even not getting headphone and usb cable with handset .
only phone , silicon cover and charger in box .
the worst device i have ever purchased
dont buy this device
i dont get the charger in it and the camera are soo poor i cant tell you , and if you use snapchat , instagram and whatsapp stories the cameras are like s # ! π
direct video call is not supporting
ram capacity it not found anywhere in this phone
in comparison with mi note 4 , this phone doesn &apos;t stand anywhere .
features and functions of asus zenfone max pro m1 is 30 % of mi note 4
software is not heavy as mi note 4
i think nothing in this phone but waste of money
call recording is not available
camera is also not so good
replacement policy of flipkart is so poor
mobile quality is very bad
product is but some features is missing
2 alram not working when mobile is off
3 net speed is not seen on disply
4 bhoke mode not available
5 them are not available
6 asus security not available
7 screen shot not available
8 call recording not available
9 gallery not available
10 improve more camera function
11 ram free spece not seen on disply
after all this mobile is very good for any use
it has heating issues , it lags sometimes , battery drains very fast , i bought it 2days ago and it shows all of those problems so i will suggest you don &apos;t buy this phone
i ordered it on 30th of august recieved the product by the 1st of september it was running smoothly and fine and then unfortunalety it stopped working by the 2nd of september automatically .
the phone it on but nothing appears on the screen .
it just keep on blinking with black screen .
it &apos;s gives me haptic feed back of vibration when i hold down the power button .
i tried to reboot it but nothing happens .
the screen blinks with black screen again and again .
overrated and overpriced for a phone which provides camera comparable to nokia &apos;s 5 megapixel camera and battery draining out in a day .
only processing speed is the feature that has been true to their claim .
can &apos;t see data speed
doesn &apos;t have scheduled power on and off feature
if you switch off phone at night you &apos;ll miss the alarm cause it won &apos;t switch itself on for alarm like other phones do
sir screen clarity is zero my previous mob moto is too gud
dear friends if you are willing to by this phone then this are my reviews for this phone after the use of 15days
1 ) main camera : - is not able to take close up with flash on as apurtur can &apos;t control the light and photo gets all falshy
2 ) display : -is fhd + but colours feel all washed out
finger print touch is not working in camera .
gallery is not available .
music player is not available .
video player is not available .
dual app is not available .
call recording not available .
file manager not great .
totally shocked by absence of these grt n most basic features in sch a latest phone .
how it will compete with redmi note 5 pro which offers so mch .
this is a to much bad product .
it &apos;s a very good phone has all the specs which a true up to date smartphone would need .
the battery power is a 100 and the ram of 6gb truly a cherry on the cake .
it has it cons when it comes to camera but that can be overlooked through some apps .
it is truly worth your money .
both the camera are very good and the battery capacity is good .
it has heating issue
there was some problem and after updating the problem is been solved
but i don &apos;t like the max box instead of that they can give a wired headset
the max box was broken in a week
it does not have quick charging support it take more than 3hours of charging
and finally thanks for the flipkart for the fast delivery , it took 24 hrs to get delivered
best phone for gamers it has hdr + ultra option in .
after 1.5 years of usage the mobile got completely fried
camera is slow to click pic and delete.when we r scrolling up and down its stucking .
immediately i place return order .
after using 1,5y its a good phone
but sucks when it comes to updates but minor bugs
back cover good but it will gain dents with time
every feature works fine
and asus is good company and no service provider in india now sadly 2020 sucks
flipkart gave me a broken glass with it
asus zenfone max pro m1 is a money waste phone .
in 2 years of usage 2time battery damaged .
camera like 2k mobile phone camera .
very disappointed from asus .

superb phone in this price range
good product within this price range .
only one feedback. screen class cover should have provided with the phone .

camera quality in daylight is too good but night photo quality could have been better .
nice product asus phone
love at first sight best budget phone with all required features standing o to asus
good phone used for 2 years upto now and still using .
2.good performance due to 6 gb ram
3.good battery life 5000 mah once charge can be used full day
3.less features compared to other phone due to stock android
nice phone in this budget but the only problem is the battery backup it not like the 5000mah battery
love u asus. lovely mobile .
good one its been 2 years i am using
good phone about all over performance
not worth for money
i have used my phone for 1year and now i &apos;m writing the review overall the phone is awesome .the camera is normal as compared to other brands rest is awesome
only eight months used now it &apos;s not working very bad .
very good product. mainly battery , cameras and it &apos;s processor 6gb ram. i recommend to buy it .
sound is very low
excellent battery backup and performance .
good for gaming and daily usage .
i have been using this phone from last 2 years almost .
best phone in the range .
poor phone with every hanging ui
best cell phone with great features at best price with best quality .
camera night photo is not good .
and capture after photo then photo light is low .
such an awesome phone , you cannot find a better phone than this at any rate .
i bought this phone for rs 15,000 but it is not worth it
wonderful cell phone ️ ️ ️
direct video call not available .
call recording not available
too much problems in heavy use .
i suggest this one for this price range .
i really disappointed for this mobile .
after 22 months of use battery get fully discharged and battery is totally not working condition .
in charging time mobile going to very high heat and fully charged upto 96 % only .
after charging battery going down 0 % within 2 hours .
worst smartphone .after one year use the battery is gone completely.service is also so poor that they it will take 2 weeks to get the battery replaced.i was forced to buy a new phone .
please never buy this.its total waste of money
mobile always going fast boot mode. very problem
just awesome handset. this is the best phone among all i used
i bought this 2 years ago and still using this as my main phone it &apos;s good to have this it &apos;s worth the price .
the battery is not up to mark
used for 1 year .
i was not buying it but my friends suggested this phone .
thanks to him very much satisfied with video quality , very good performance.camera is very good .
2 days no worry due to battery backup : )
its a good phone .
worked great even after 2 years
good performing phone in a reasonable price
it &apos;s not a good quality if tap double on screen than its zoom
good phone for day to day usage
bettary prob not work after 1 yr
no doubt excellent . must by
performance is great compared to other phones that were launched at the se time and at similar pricepoint .
however the problem is regarding its durability .
you will have to use a case or screen guard to protect this phone .
the phone &apos;s screen tends to break quiet easily .
and the problem is even with a small crack the phone &apos;s display tends to become unresponsive and eventually non functinal .
i am writing this review after 1year and 8 months of usage .
i am using this phone for more than 1 and half year .
1 ) best part of this phone is active voice cancellation during call this will remove noise from your background and receiver will not know where the hell you are . !
3 ) battery life really good .
4 ) good gaming phone : pubg runs smooth with 6 gb
5 ) durable : it fell like hell many times but no issue noted till now .
waste phone i ever seen , over heating battery drains fastly don &apos;t waste money to buy this phone
value for money phone of 2018
good quality product from asus .
battery failure phone waste and worest product
display is very delicate .
some times mobile gets heated up while charging .
overall good if you are not a heavy user .
very very very nice mobile
i just use 1 year 2 month and my display broke and nothing work properly it &apos;s bad experience for me
i &apos;m using this phone for 2years and it &apos;s performance is still good .
only in 9 months my handset battery is blossom , 1st time very bad experience with this product .
very very worst mobile i used till now .
i cant even explain about the worst features of this phone. plzzz dont ever buy
little to none problems .
good for playing games .
no heating issues , smmoth graphics
worst phone ever used by me .
had problems with it all along
worst don &apos;t buy this phone it works good only for 6 months then after u will hate this because of it &apos;s performance the phone suddenly strucks in the middle of the games like pubg .
please don &apos;t buy this one. this is honest review .
good camera , but poor processor performance as most of the ram cannot be use . because prossesor doesn &apos;t support it .as a result relatively lag and screen stucks while gaming frequently .
so dont buy for today &apos;s time . as it not stand in market competition .
asus very bad company
super good phone nice delivery filplart
no and never buy asus mobile phone because the does not provide a better update soo i request to buy xiaomi or realme phones don &apos;t buy asus phone
very bad camera and battery backup
performance is very bad
all of quality is bad
waste of money for this phone
camera quality is too low as price
main highlight of phone was camera but it &apos;s the worst part of the mobile
after 1 year camera &apos;s result is mind-blowing .
very good product , nice to use
best phone under 12000
great phone in this price.no heating problem during playing pubg game .good graphics.battary long lasting .
i was very happy and satisfied with the product .
so i decided to upgrade to asus zenfone max pro m1 .
after using for quite few days i felt in love with it .
battery backup is also better .
only thing i felt downgraded was the camera quality .
rest all is value for money .
budget phone with plus specifications
this mobile 1 year after automatically dead
screen got broken with small impact
the worsted mobile in the world .
nice product but in its software has many bugs
nice phone when compared to redmi note 5pro
nice camera to know more about camer please follow _ fallen _ a.n.g.e.l _
only battery is very good , hanging problem is more than others phone .
awasome product. after 16 month uses no complain . terrific purchase .
no hang , long lasting battery , very good camera. all good .
overall ok but it &apos;s display screen , glass whatever they have used is really really bad , i would say lenovo phone which i used has tough screen .
don &apos;t buy this phone
overall the performance of the phone is good
however there are certain cons with the product
to list some of them .
it requires to many clicks to capture a image and sometimes even the picture is not saved
the back button responds on 2 to 3 clicks
the fingerprint sensor is not up to the mark , it takes to much attempt to unlock
worst possible product from asus .
the phone is big zero in all aspects i would say , at least my phone which i received from flipkart seller
camer battery always super
really bad experience with network .
call recording problem not a good
good product and good service
performance is too bad .
battery life is worse .
simply waste of money .
i seriously suggest not to buy this phone even by mistake .
because once you buy it. flikart will not even provide you proper return policy .
i &apos;m seriously disappointed with this phone .
but i &apos;m helpless about it .
nothing to complain till now on 2020 feb 1
camera is quite note good .
performance is good till now .
very nice strong android
after usage of 18 months still it works like brand new .
it &apos;s my life partner
timely delivery by flipkart
worst purchase ever on flipkart .
the best phone at its budget
best mobile under 15000
value for money good product
nice product but after 1 years performance is low but battery backup is very good
ok. so i bought this phone in 2019 .
let me tell you my experience and the necessary do &apos;s and dont &apos;s .
1 ) do not buy an extra back cover separately because it comes with one in the box itself .
although it is not mentioned in the description of inbox items .
2 ) very rarely i experienced a bug which hangs the phone .
restart may fix it but a permanent solution is still required .
3 ) the pie update is available now but i still recommend not to update .
to much good battery performance good for gaming good camera good functions overall good product in small amount
prompt delivery by fliipcart
out standing phone in this price value for money good performance thank you seller and thank you flipkart
good phone for this rate , i am using for more than 1 year its working fine
worst product i didn &apos;t expect from asus like this
from 2018 october using this but still i am using this for 2 days without charging using for 5-6hrs a day .
ram management is great till know in 2020 jan .
the apk i left in background run for continuous 6-8hrs .
super busy with work
i &apos;m using this product for 1 year and got no performance issues .
i play asphalt 8 daily and still it runs smoothly .
i give the max details in my review .
on heavy usage too battery lasts 2 days to fall to 0 % .
perfect finish giving stylish look .
camera optimization is bad in dim lights .
no better features than older versions .
it doesn &apos;t have even inbuilt app lock , hiding apps , not much of personalisation .
god &apos;s product to buy but no android updates
very happy from the product .
all over this phone is good
writting this review almost after using this device for a year
battery backup was initially 2 days + and now it &apos;s down to 1.5 - 2 days depending on the amount of calls i recieve for that day .
initially disliked the camera as slo-mo was and is not available but the quality of photos in good lighting is just amazing the bokeh mode just works like butter in good condition light
now when it comes to performance this phone is still young as it &apos;s working exactly the same from day one .
i have been using for the past one year .
update in january 2020 :
though in settings it &apos;s not showing , the same is enabled automatically .
check the uploaded image .
further native video calling is enabled when both caller and receiver smartphone is capable .
this option automatically shows when both caller and receiver are on volte network .
worst product till my life
the mobile protection plan is useless
please don &apos;t buy this phone.for first three months , it will be good.after three months , it will start it &apos;s duty.there will be so many problems in phone.battery will not stand for 8hrs itself.please try another mobile
battery only usege no worth for money
not so much expectation
full damage . total lose
has a lot of software issues .
the display starts fluttering suddenly and to stop it i have lock the phone and unlock it and some times have to restart it switch it off .
cemara is not good
battery is super cool
useless camera and after second otg update battery is taking near about 5h of time to get fully charged .
back panel is getting scratches very easily so you have to put back cover all the time .
about performance : overall performance is good never experienced lag so far .
phone is awesome but the touch becomes unresponsive after the android 9 upgrade , it is not a hardware issue tho .
i managed to make the touch work by restarting the phone with pressing simultaneously the power key and upper volume key .
it has 6gb ram but have poor performance when compared with any .
but battery is draining if we keep it 🤔 🤔
very worst product don &apos;t buy it
this mobile was purchased by my younger brother and i was happy with battery performance .
secondly my dad purchased and finally it was my turn
happy with the battery performance and camera quality .
i &apos;m writing this after 4 months of usage .
good phone cameras are ok battery is good for one day .
touch is good ram is good .
it &apos;s a good phone at this price range .
pubg runs smooth not like apple. but it &apos;s ok. to play and battery is really good . this is a genuine review of 1.5 year old user . .
nowadays real me is aslo a good option .
i have been using since year lot of bugs but not annoying
1. sound is mute even not vibrate if you set manual ringtone on settings tab .
after system update issue resolved
2. u can &apos;t able to connect internet sometimes very occasionally while using wifi hotspot tethering to pc or phone but same time we can able to connect internet when we use usb tethering .
3. if battery dried phone may getting hanged ( i don &apos;t think so this would be expected for all smartphones )
best value for money .
battery performance is great .
owsm devise. worth to buy. m using 6 gb varient .
best value phone 6gb ram only 10038
its really very good
8 months since i purchased , everything is perfect and now there is a software issue which has come up stating your phone is corrupt .
how to get out of this ?
i like the phone but i didn &apos;t like the touch as it is not that responsive and sensitive
good product and cheapest price
this mobile one of the one
very bad quality of display got damaged in 1 month
bord complint after 1 year and 1 month
pro : you will be satisfied for this money. one year completed , still battery stands for a day and bit more .
con : accessories wont be available in the physical store
now 1year completed. awesome product .

phone display damage please change
very good good quality good performance everything is better
battery backup is good but camera is average
good product good service
very nice product good packing
it is not user friendly and lot of default options are not available
i bought this phone on being suggested by a friend .
the battery holds on for a day , even after heavy usage , high graphic gaming included .
pictures get blurry in low light .
the display is a standard one .
the debate was between redmi note 7s and this phone .
i &apos;ll say , if you want a better camera , go for redmi .
however , asus fares better , overall .
this phone is suitable for those searching for gaming phone under rs 10000. it has good battery backup , for a single charge i got around 32hrs of backup even after the mobile data was on for the whole time .
but the camera was very bad during night .
apart from that it is good phone under 10k
after one month of use i don &apos;t get any version update its very disappointing .
and this phones finger print sensor is very slow some times it &apos;s not working .
but it &apos;s not a major problem .
when i restart the phone then it works normally but after 2 or 3 days of use it again working slower .
don &apos;t worry it &apos;s a software issue only they can fix this by software updates .
after 1 month use i have only this two problems nothing more .
let &apos;s discuss about everything of this phone
front camera very bad
phone is worth the money , flipkart has delayed delivery several times and has been troublesome with delivery .
not at all recommended .
i have purchased 4 asus mobiles .
but not at all satisfied with this one .
need a replacement although returned period is gone .
have been using the phone since last 6 months , camera is awesome .
wonderful performance. just go for it
runs high graphic games smoothly .
battery backup is low considering 5000mah capacity .
full charge takes time .
after a year , it takes around 3 hrs to get fully charged .
camera quality lowers down in the dark .
during bright light , camera quality is excellent .
sometimes heats up during gaming .
exchange product a new mobile
for 1st year it works good , then it &apos;s showing multiple issue , just like battery discharge , performance issue .
i am using it from may18 and till date it &apos;s working excellent .
must be the best phone in the price range when compared with the features available .
heavy in weight but that could be bearable , the worst thing is its accessories , even its tempered glass and back cover not available in market and can be bought rarely even on online too .
very disappointed with the service .
there are better options available in market with the lesser price than it is .
phone is good but there is problem with its battery .
battery issues i faced since i bought this phone .
it &apos;s been only 6 months since i have bought this phone and it &apos;s already glitching out .
excellent battery backup , performance , i think best mobile within this range
finger print scanner is very bad .
do not sense finger print immediately .
oftenly scan fingerprint very late or when pressed forcefully .
after 1year battery backup performance is very poor
after using 1 year there is battery problem .
battery will drain within fraction of seconds and blowing backside and camera quality is very bad , there is no proper software update from asus .
i am not able to use properly because battery issue
high fps drop and unstable network connectivity issue in pubg .
recommend only to normal users
an excellent phone with stock android .
please remove the bugs except that everything is great .
overall this is good .
but my charging time is increasing before completing 1 year .
black spot appears in my mobile screen. which disappointed me the most .
still 1 year not completed .
picture quality is good .
great buy at this price point .
very good sound quality .
camera ok , but night photo needs improvement .
overall thumbs up for asus
i am very unhappy for total performance of this device
the phone keeps on hanging and now the phone is not responding .
it doesn &apos;t switch on .
after 1 year of usage still no lagging observed .
camera is above average .
other than camera all other features still giving equal competition with the newly launched mobiles after 1 year .
bogus camera , no gallery
very good but cemara just bad
bad product , camera quality not good .
selfie touch not work properly
my suggestion is dont buy this phone
no battery life , low network coverage , overall good and value for money .
more than 1year i use this mobile .
stock android ( easy to use )
battery ( long lasting 1 and 1 / 2 day )
aluminum body ( standard quality )
camera ( decent camera )
display ( very sharp )
speaker ( sound quality good and crisp )
best for this price
camera picture quality bed
very high quality for camera and having high speed performance
voice is not heard
after using the phone for a year , i can say the battery has been disappointing .
otherwise , the phone is good .
phone is not a bad
this phone has a strong built quality
charger faulty after 3 month
finger print scanner stops working frequently .
best product but low briteness
display and some software type issues other wise amazing mobile
good mobile in this price range
best choice for every one for mobile users .
it is a good phone
average , not bad but not go for it
it &apos;s a really good mobiles. battery back up wonderful. photo image too good .
i have purchased two pieces this mobile . really value for money .
it &apos;s been 1year and still working like boss .
you can &apos;t unlike this after one year even .
i m happy with my phone
comparative to today market . is is outdated
this is wroest phone
1 ) battery and display good
1 ) speed very slow .
not upto the mark as per hardware configuration and which they claim .
2 ) finger sensor sometimes not works properly
3 ) earphones not provided with phone
the phone is superb but if you don &apos;t like to use stoke android , don &apos;t but it go for mi ( redmi )
now i want to tell you that the accessories is very bad quality only 3month your data cable definitely off . i purchased data cable 3timesfrom their showroom but always it not work after 2-3 month no warrenty claim .
camera is very bad for compare to other it &apos;s not like 16mp like 8mp only . no gallery they provide the blure image shows always .
good product for value of money
my new phone is not getting charged with the charger even after 5-6 hours .
the batter goes out within one day .
4 days of use .
phone works like a charm .
no issues till now .
everything else is the worst in class .
awesome phone in this price point .
its an excellent product and flipkart delivers it very well and with good packaging and without and problems and issues .
if you are thinking to buy it you can trust me buy without hesitations .
its is dhamal i bought 4 for my whole family members
everything good except few cons
1 ) little bit heavy weight
2 ) ear phone point coluld be above rather than below
this is an awesome phone .
completely satisfied on every front .
i intentionally bought the older model when m2 came out
everything is great except , i use 3rd party camera app which works great
i &apos;m buying this smart phone 03 oct 2018
now 18 oct 2019
after 1 year later still mobile very well and good condition i &apos;m impress very with this smartphone
i am using this mobile from past 4 months.really good
battery backup is very good , battery life is 2 days or more on normal usage
5000 mah battery draining in 2 hours .
very battery bad performance .
facing problem everytime updating the system update .
nice product. value for money
awesome and reasonable mobile than other smart phone
after 1year 10 days my 6gb variant mobile battery damaged .
using from 1year and buy another one .
it &apos;s the best phone with such a good configuration .
really value for money and recommended to my friends .
but now there is very good competitor for this phone .
so now asus should come with some more competitive configuration for new phone .
what i have noticed about asus phone that it &apos;s not compatible with my jabra wireless bluetooth headset .
phone got delivered on the 9th day i.e 17th oct and the order was placed on 9th , ( one day after the committed date ) .
so , 1 star to flipkart for such pathetic delivery .
but fantastic phone. on all parameters. camera , sound quality , call quality , battery , worth it at this price of 11500 / - 6gb ram variant. thanku asus .
wifi is getting disconnected again and again .
tower reception is very bad .
don &apos; buy this phone ( 1 ) bad sound quality ( 2 ) bad camera _ _ no slow motion option , no time laps option no panoramic viue option ( 3 ) 6gb ram then hang .
i was using an honor and feel like i am back to stone age with the asus .
no doubt it is higher config but the things i can fo with my honor are unimaginable with the asus
this needs an update for camera and bluetooth problems a lot , apart from this everything &apos;s good
dad of mi note 5 pro
the best mobile i ever used , after using it for one year heavily.till now no problems.love asus
looks good and handy .
wonderful product , it is very use full .
camera quality is poor than same range of xiaomi phones .
apps close suddenly , run time error .
slow processing with any hard use .
doesn &apos;t justify the price of above 10k .
perfect price perfect product
device died after a year .
nice phone in this range
so bad but ok
i have been using this phone for more than 9 months .
what i like the most is its battery life .
you can play high quality games as well as online gaming too
super fast charging and camera quality is also good .
no lagging even after multitasking .
even it supports reverse charging too which helped me a lot .
very good battery life and performance .
average product at good price
at this price this phone is good .
excellent condition after 1 year .
it is excellent product .
very good packing mobile is very nice but brightness is low .
this phone doesn &apos;t have a gallery .
you have to install one from playstore
except this everything is fine
this is a nice product .
heating issues generated after around 10 months of usage .
but , got it right from the service center .
camera is not that good as expected .
extra 5mp back camera is not working with 16mp back camera
and picture quality is not good enough
but my phone battery is damaged in 13 months .
it have only 12months warranty .
all are fine working but some time main speaker not working on main but working upper speaker on that time .
it has enough battery back after using all day internet , you tube continue listening music online yet its battery lasts around upto second till night .
brilliant for this budget
superb mobile , more value for money if the display is better .
never hangs , timely updates .
overall a good purchase .
but although i purchased 6gb version , performance is just as 4gb only
unbelievably poor performance with lots of issues. never thought asus will make such devices .
awesome camera details 🤫
writing this review after 3 months of use .
very good phone , best 6gb variant in up to 20k range .
camera could hv been better but other features are very satisfactory .
awesome speed n transition very smooth .
look n feel , wo derful
charger and battery poor performance
well and good mobile
everything is good but after long use heating issue generated .
after using 6 + months its performing with full satisfactory
good product only for average use battery is awesome but not good for multitasking it will lag after 5 to 6 app open side by side and gaming experience is just average
this phone is really outstanding. fantastic mobile phone ever seen before .
16 + 5 back camera are very worst not value for this money in this mobile
there is difference to operate other android phones
value for money and getting updation automatically .
everything is good except the mic. because of too much noise cancellation our voice itself considered to be noise .
good price in budget
i like it very much
nice very good product
product is not reliable .
please dont go for flipkart mobile protection plan it is useless and waste of money .
best in price and product quality is good
excellent phone in this range , also got update of pie from oreo
advice no one to buy this device .
nice phone speed is too good
getting regular updates. and that &apos;s a good thing .
after using it for one year it is working well .
awesome product value for money
great phone i like it
my asuz zenphone max pro stopped working all on a sudden after one year .
can &apos;t turn it on
good product at this cost
front camera automatically beautifies ( uglifies ) photos. charger is charging the phone in 7 hrs after 8 months .
the phone is best , only one problem , not record facility inbuilt mi
i bought this phone 4 month ago .
within this budget , this is best phone , specially i like battery performance which is so good
just once the touch not worked but after going to care it was sorted out.amazing product good for our daily use .
its a request never buy this phone i am using from past 1 year .
this phone is useless .
you don &apos;t get any proper timely updates l , lots of bugs , heating issues , battery drainage etc .
awesome phone best in everything
awesome in price range
but there are so many bugs
phone is good but , camera is not good
nice but not nice
nice low budget 6 gb ram and nice pafroming very fast access good
good one for gaming
value for money. battery performance is good .
mobile camera is low quality but battery pack up and mobile using is good smooth
very happy to buy this mobile. but some irritated with screen guard. otherwise very good
nice piece of phone but camera is not so good if u r camera lover than ull be dissatisfied .
it would have been the best phone in the segment , if it had the basic water resistant coating.its really gets weird in heavy rain.the speakers doesn &apos;t work properly during high humidity.other wise a nice budget oriented phone .
the phone is really very good .
this is the second time i &apos;ve ordered this phone for a reason which is it &apos;s value for money that is the special point of this phone
being a heavy duty gamer i wanted a phone which had a hell load od a battery backup and a nice camera as well
i &apos;ll give my review as
5 / 5 for overall build
it &apos;s been almost 10 months without any problem .
processing is also fast enough .
it &apos;s a good choice for the people searching for a budgeted phone with good configuration .
phone is to good
good hardware , but poor software updates .
it was great but there was a problem with camera the portrait mode was not working since last 1 year .
otherwise cellphone was great i am using since last 1.3 years no heating , no hang , no any other problems detected .
do something with camera .
camera is nice charging is toooo good
good product . nice parformance
have a lot to praise .
but , unbeatable phone at this price .
processor is top notch
no lagging at all .
nice phone only display light problem sometimes
best mobile in this price range
all the features are great .
i have problem in fingerprint lock
otherwise a decent product
i wish asus sort the problem for the future costumers
very pathetic experience with this device , flipkart is not trust worthy for this purchase , a good android phone .
but camera lacks quality both front and back cameras .
good in looks , slim and easy to carry .
battery is good , fast charging with original charger .
since i &apos;m using from a year not a single glitch witnessed .
camera and performance should be better .
camera ( video / camera ) qty not best at night the only bad in this product .
pub-g can b played best in this phone battery backup awesome .
worst phone i have ever seen. network issue , main board gets damaged every month , i.c problem .
not even a. single day i have not faced problem .
i would highly recommend not to buy this phone at all .
if you purchase this phone then purchase it at your responsibility .
service is very very very poor .
worth phn in this price segment
this phone my full family using super phone
u can use it in a y condition or climate
great phone 1yr completed
software is the only downside .
and battery life isn &apos;t great due to bad optimization
awesome thanks for flipkart fast delivery and also thanks to asus make a very special phone like max pro m1
a good product from asus
the best phone that i &apos;ve used forever .
i use 1 phone per year .
i bought it for last big billion day but it &apos;s the only phone that have withstood my rough handling .
recommend to those who are handle carelessly
i am very satisfied with this mobile phone .
this is one of the best purchases from flipkart .
but flipkart makes me fool by exchange offer .
i had old redmi note 3 .
that phone have only one scratch even you didn &apos;t notice .
the delivery man try to find out that scratch for a long period of time .
after that , he denies taking that old phone .
otherwise , all are good .
three-star for flipkart &apos;s service not for the product .
asus zenfone max pro m1 is awesome phone , never lag and the battery is marvelous .
been using the 6gb ram variant for 1 yr now .
apart from camera ( u can install gcam pretty easily ) rest of the things are really really good .
pics frm gcam showcase the true power of this phone &apos;s hardware .
near to stock android ui keeps things pretty simple .
the ui is light on resources yet very functional .
ram management is a bit aggressive .
apps like truecaller which need to stay alive , they restart after a while .
phone is not handy and bigger in size so i personally dont like that bigger sized phones .
battery life is good , camera is fine , sound quality is nice and performance is good
overall if u like big phones then u can go for this one
body is robust and strong
awesome phone at its price range .
i would say the best one
pros , great battery , great performance.cons , poor camera performance especially the front camera , both front and rear camera pictures aren &apos;t good at low light conditions.overall performance not bad .
the phone camera is bad
camera quality was upto the level value for money
cannot find any panorama option available
asus is best smartphone ever
a good product in sense of battery and performance .
camera quality is not that much fine but due to it &apos;s high ram .
it supports high application support .
i purchased this mobile 7th july 19 but after 1month mobile trouble me many more ways , like whenever call arrived screen become totally black and doesn &apos;t show callers name .
and during call , voice interrupted many times .
3-4 baar call karne k baad hi baat ho paati h. i am extremely disappointed with this mobile .
this phone dont even has gallery for personal photos !
not normal phone to use !
working great after 1 year also and best for multitasking !
just the design is not so modern as it is launched some time ago but it is excellent .
one of the best budget phones with excellent features except camera which is average .
its a awesome i feel branded
the camera is awesome .
excellent phone in this price segment
11 months usage -
there &apos;s no other phone that has everything like this does .
even max pro m2 or asus 5z or 6z miss some basic stuff that this phone has .
some of the loveable things about this phone :
-the battery will last a day , no matter what you do !
i left bluetooth on for about 5 hours straight. it drained to 15 % from 65 , that &apos;s ridiculous - i happily listened to songs as i went home , with battery saver on .
pathetic phone. gets bad and bad with every update . # fakeasus is cheating people. first and last asus phone for me .
phone is not so good as it &apos;s configurations are , sometimes it is charging fast sometimes not .
there is bug issue also.camera is also not so good as 16 mp .
it &apos;s not look like 6gb ram processor .
it &apos;s been an year i am using this phone .
no lag till now and battery backup is good till now .
only issue i faced it is that there is no option for video calls via volte vial phone dailer .
so i need to diable volte and use jio voice for video calls .
very nice picture and camera super
good product value for money
an excellent product within such a budget .
it has got an excellent battery backup .
best mid range device ever
excellent fast speed no any issue facing till now , camera has very decent photo shot but not great. it must be improved from software updates .
battery is beast. one of the reason to buy this .
built quality is great. a lot of toughness
sd 636 processor with ddrx4 ram which is faster than it &apos;s competitor .
very very very good product and this phone is marvelous performance
no words monster battery
super battery backup , good performance , camera quality is ok
finger sensor is not working properly
not satisfied with camera
if you want the performance then it is the best in this budget but if you &apos;re looking for camera , this will not be the one you &apos;re looking for .
very slow and , performance is very bad good value for money
poor display broken while keeps in pocket
performance not as six gb ram mobile
app and memory management not good
not value for money
unable to use jio video cal facility .
poor finger print sensor
worst phone i ever had .
only good thing is its camera .
otherwise everything is frustrating .
the display is awful , broke easily .
love the phone but not the bugs that all i can say
very very good phone
v.nice mobile phone in all respect. thanku
supper phone ever seen best phone for all activities and best gaming phone
awesome mobile at 12k camera is good , performance is great , battery backup is very good , and the built quality is great .
after used one year also have good performance .
not good touch and screenshot and gallery or other
smartphone features are not available

not call recording option .
one of the best is long battery life

2 days after the order
best in this range
aftert using one month it starts troubling like automatic switch off , screen error , hanging , some times launcher error , some times it behaves like broken like lines will come on screen , some times it goes to sleep like we can &apos;t use any button or option

the only disadvantage is to there is no fast charging support .
image quality is good especially for 6gb version
great phone for this budget ️
my mobile suddenly off than not on .
i am happy with this product
we can trust asus .
it will be good if asus give updation for camera stabilisation for better performance .
overall good n value for money n built quality
simply waste of money. no any own app by asus.all apps are from google.even contacts , massage , calender etc .
only brand used by asus and nothing else .
it is inferior than asus zenfone 5 which was my earlier purchased .
amazing with 6 gb ram .
this is after i added google camera on my max pro m1 .
performance wise i wud give it a 3.5 / 5 after a good one year use .
the stock camera app is garbage .
but google camera does the justice .
still doesn &apos;t hang after one year .
worth phone in this range .
a nice design and well built body .
software and interface looks good and fast .
battery backup is good .
camera is average.i will suggest and look for some other alternatives in this price range .
nice fast and awesome phone
it was too good
absolutely amazing phone thanks flipkart for early delivery
problem solved but twenty days not quick
it &apos;s kind of ok phone , battery and performance wise it &apos;s really good .
display is good as well .
disappointed with its camera software .
slo motion is not available .
there are some bugs which they have not fixed even after multiple update releases .
you can &apos;t swipe down on homescreen to open notification panel .
2. when you unlock phone with finger it still tries to unlock with your face as well and makes a click sound .
good phone at a price range of 12k
good battery , good storage n ram n stock android
lags in pubg , bad camera n bad fingerprint response .
nice delivery by the boy
good mobile after 1 year of use .
except battery everything is use less
i have been using the phone for over a year .
the battery stays for over a day and does not heat up at all .
the performance of the phone is awesome and switched through apps hassle free .
had no major issues till now .
camera is decent and takes fine pictures with depth and other modes .
timely android updates are available .
they also provide a boom stand for the phone in the box .
the volume of the phone keeps changing after each update .
its a very nice device in this range

good device. value for money
value for money , exceptionally well performance , camera not the best but better than other phones , screen is also one of the best .
video quality is very poor
my real statement regarding this mobile . i am having 6 gb 64 gb variant . but i face alot of lag and screen issue .
this phone worth the money with it &apos;s features .looks goods. camera can be improved , battery is very good .
affordable phone with good features .
i am using this phone 4gb ram 64gb varrient from 1 year till now i have not faced any kind of issue in this phone
i used this product single handed .
it just got dead after 12 months .
i got very bad response from the phone .
i have to buy a 2nd phone within a period of 13 months .
full wastage of money .
no one is taking responsibility , flipkart and asus both disappointed me .
my 15000 rupees got wasted .
it &apos;s a value for money buy .
but the problem with the camera is worst .
some automatic filters works really bad .
after 6months of usage .
battery life is really good .
display works very good , no scratches after rough use ( important : not used screen guard ) .
worth buying if you don &apos;t bother camera .
check eyes on the below pic .
asus is best product and due to warranty card our phone is safe
it &apos;s value for money
do not purchase this phone .
i face some complain on this phone .
some of options on display like ∆ , o , &#91; &#93; , are missing sometimes .
after restarting my phone missing options are displayed .
sometimes internet not working when i restart phone and internet is working .
so every time phone need to restart !
ver y good mobile

really good the best mobile ever because it gives you all the quality which you needed in 2-3 phones
sound quality is very bad
if you dont like asus then try this you will love asus
it &apos;s a great phone .
flipkart services are exceptionally good .
no direct video call

performance is very good. but the display is not working sometime after if we restart
this phone is only waste of money don &apos;t buy this phone
good mobile and sound quality amazing
camera quality is average but the battery backup is really nice .
after few months of usage fingerprint sensor doesn &apos;t work properly .
even after having 6 gb ram when you work with multiple app the phone hangs and the screen blackouts .
superb phone , i am very much satisfied with its performance , battery , ui , camera , and of course storage and ram .
its about to be of 8 months , yet i have not encountered any major issue .
best phone with this budget but u now not so worth of price with new launch
at this cost asus has really touched a milestone with the configuration the phone holds .
camera performs well in daylight as compared to nyt .
product is good , camera is normal and battery performance is supb .
but it &apos;s late delivered , anyway thanks flipcart team for good delivery
face unlock never worked since i bought it .
now from may 2019 , i have stopped getting updates .
so many bugs already in software .

very bad and poor to catch the signal .
best mobile for this budget just go for it blindly super mobile .

excellent mobile for this price. the battery beast. juz luv it .
such an amazing product .
worst camera , sometimes fingerprint and face unlock won &apos;t work .
instead of fixing bugs they just introduce new bugs .
all needs are done
wow , what an amazing piece of expert technology
budget phone got for reasonable price happy buyer
such a great product
not for heavy users lagging and heating issue not satisfied with the performance overall even small games lagging
bad product after my purchase of just three months phone has problem .
phone has automatically on and off how can i solve my problem please solve my issue
performance is very very poor .
don &apos;t buy it as asus made this phone for bug testing .
only bug is being updated
you should think before buy it .
camera results are very poor .
low budget best mobile
i m happy with mobile
screen brightness is low .
you have to keep brightness setting on high to view the contents .
picture quality is not like a 16 mp camera .
no video call function is given .
you have to depend on third party app .
call recording feature is also not available .
but , of course mobile runs smooth as it has 6gb ram .
only problem is that i have to go 5-6km to get the delevery from my home .
they don &apos;t deliver at my given address .
coming to my phone which excellent in every way. no lag , little heating issue , didn &apos;t get android pie udates yet .and after three months of usage i got android pie update .
good mobile , low price 6 gb ram
mobile phone is awesome and thanks to flipkart to deliver this phone shortly .
such a nice phone in this price .
camera quality is good considering the price range .
battery backup is beyond expectation .
4g internet speed is too good .
only display brightness is a bit low as compared to others , but that can be ignored considering other performances .
don &apos;t pay attention to negative comments .
just go for it blindly , surely you won &apos;t regret .
but improve delevery process
nice product i &apos;m totally satisfied with asus m1 pro 6 gb ram .
but do not give updates .
it will be bad .
flipkart for nice delivery for me .
no issues since 3months usage .
games like pubg and other high graphics games work awesome in this .
battery is life is very satisfying .
with minimum usage it works for 1nd half to 2 days .
astounding piece of art
after mite than 6 months usage experience .
1 ) speaker sound quality poor
3 ) camera below average to poor .
users not advised to take photo any photo in low light .
don &apos;t expect sharp crisp and clear image even in sunlight .
camera is real low end .
not meant for heavy games
5 ) multi tasking not so good
6 ) cheap hardware used .
after pie update don &apos;t getting exact battery back approximately getting only 3000mah
my second mobile , both running fins .
camera - best ( need good software like cameramx )
battery - very powerful ( 2 days with moderate to heavy internet )
sound - loud and crisp ( clean for songs )
os - all applications running smoothly .
i am using this phone from last two months
no merge option for duplicate contact ( skype , duo , google , whatsapp , . &quot; displaying multiple contact list for one &quot; )
no inbuilt video calling option ( for video calling we have to use separate app like : duo )
sometime hanging problem ( when we restart the phone or removing charging to phone )
of course android version 9 ( not having latest features )
battery backup is very very good .
a good phone in value of money but need to improve it &apos;s camera quality
nice phone for gamers and a decent look for office work .
all in one phone
data is very less
it &apos;s worth for this range .
excellent phone with highest configuration in its price band but software updates need to improve .
its so fast , performance is nice .
just say subrb. camera awsme. and battery is suprb. my 2nd mobile choice only from asus bcz cam and battery .
it is very good item
this is not asus phone total difference inbuilt programs its no inbuilt call recorder and no asus apps like note and camer qwality not good and phone is very bad perfome hanging
this come for lot of problems in mobile it &apos;s not a good product
you &apos;re not 12 full month this product works excellent .
camera we can use google camera application its excellent image and colour reproduction .
battery and sensor would be better
what am buy now this one only .
previously 2 mobiles are good .
. it &apos;s rebooted. sorry. i don &apos;t .
want this mobile. it &apos;s not support my job culture .
good product in this price range
takes much time to capture photo
the worst phone for money
not supporting video call
no heating after constant net surfing .
not checked for gaming .
great phone under 11499 it &apos;s camera is great but it &apos;s system is not great ilike it &apos;s battery is good display is so smart
nice mobile in budget
i purchase 4 to 5 phone of this brand , till date no any issue .
product is best but delivery boy are too argumentative .
best phone for 11,499 / -
and best camera camera quality is good
i have been using this phone since a long time now and i am say too much satisfied with it .
this phone is my first asus product that i have used and i am absolutely satisfied with this .
the display is absolutely love and everything else .
good configuration @ economic price .
not even a year old , it is lagging in every aspect .
camera is the major draw back and the worst you can get .
only positive thing is the battery backup .
i am happy with this phone .
camera is just ok , slo-mo not there which is disappointing , and display screen is very week , it fell just once from my hand and screen cracked from several places despite having the screen gaurd above the glass .
needs camera optimization overall value for money mobile
i have been using this phone for last 1 year and i wanted to give an honest review of it .
the best thing about this mobile is it &apos;s value for money , if u want a phone with good features with less price this one is for u .
1 ) battery is good and long lasting without battery saver and charging is fast
2 ) 6 gb ram at this price is really amazing , i play pubg without any lags
3 ) i can use apps editing apps like lightroom or photoshop vey smoothly
this is not about the phone but about the exchange policy of flipkart .
i was to return a phone tht i was using .
the delivery guy found a extremely small gap between the body / cover of the phone and the aluminium beading of the phone and rejected the exchange .
i really thought this is a sham and an excuse .
shall think twice before buying anything on flipkart
excellent phone i have been using iphone pixel i can say asus m1 is excellent phone no issues since last one year
perfect phone with this price great bettery quality is excellent
camera quality is very bad
the phone is as good as new even after 1 year and its feature are awesome .
the speed of the phone is awesome .
camera quality needs to be improved a bit
best delivery and best asus product
this phone is asowme
very good phone but camera quality is not much effective
so far its good. purchased 3days back. at this price its very good product .
it cost me 10800 / - total , including 800rs of 1 yr physical warranty .
this mobile is best value for money
very good product , value for money .
not as good as expected
the phone is facing too many issues just after 10 months of purchase , i got the motherboard changed after that problems don &apos;t stop .
this mobile very bad
it &apos;s not a worthy phone for price .
poor camera. rainbow colours on zooming in .
camera performance on zooming an image .
camera should be improved .
battery backup is awesome
camera not dual only one asus chit one camera
its display is very smooth , running easily
excellent battery backup .
nice one value for money
very best quality products i am purchase 3rd time this smart phone
worth to buy of it &apos;s specifications .
have some disappointments in it &apos;s finger print sensitivity now .
camera hasn &apos;t any options like slow mo , panoram etc .
but quality is cool .
having so many updates .
clarity of pictures is nice .
i have bought many phones including samsung , sony , panasonic and nokia .
however this phone is a complete masterpiece with all the best features combined in one mobile phone .
worst mobile phone i ever use .
after using 1 years this mobile phone malfunctioned two time in year and sevice provided by service center is also worst they take one month for repairing of this phone .
on off button malfunctioned 2nd time .
there is no positive review for this phone after using one years .
battery dies so quickly when ever i updated this phone .
capacitive touch on off button so insensitive i used to touch multiple time but this phone unresponsive .
after using this mobile i found it only 1problem that we can not use both different sim mobile data only single use as 1 sim not 2nd
ovearll all in one package for guys who are searching for a budget phone
stock android are awesome
just in 7.5 months battery drain is super fast and charging time long .
asus zenfone m1 pro
although the battery back up is high but battery consumption is also high .
the display quality is great .
the performance is above average .
no major software bug till now .
overall it is recommended
simply superb but camera clarity is not good .
good threemonth use no issue
thanks for flipkart good , i nee for further details
asus zenfone is best of all phones
very bad product by asus and no help from anyone for return also .
good mobile , introduce in flipkart best mobile
stock android + 5000mah battery + snapdragon 636 + 6gb / 64gb in this price range = an awesome phone .

i received this phone on 2nd august 19 and used it up to 5th august 19 .
during this period it was quite well but in the morning of 6th august 19 when an incoming call was ringing then i watched that there was no display on the screen .
point to be noted that during this short period i never mishandled it or took it outdoor .
i tried to switch off it but failed to switch off .
very fast delivery is good amazing product good battery backup i like
a nice phone with good battery backup , nice full hd + display , awesome camera performance with 4k dci and 4k uhd video recording and average performance with snapdragon 636
battery is no where performing like 5000 mah
nice mobile low price
the hardware is good but the software is very bad .
the phone hangs a lot and also shuts down automatically .
the software experience is too bad that it doesn &apos;t feel like that this phone has such a hardware but feels like a 6-7 k phone .
don &apos;t buy this phone .
go for mi etc .
best phone under budget
overall performance is excellent. camera quality is not too gud but fine .
overall value for money product
good worth for money , i am satisfied with price and mobile
it was the budget killer it is the budget killer it will be the budget killer you can play pubg hd graphics what else you want to know about the performance
after 10 month of use it has no merits. only cons .
1.direct video call not available , u have to use what &apos;s app. or fb or google video call
2.some times. it &apos;s earpiece and speaker stop working .

all things is good but mobile camera quality is not so effective .
it &apos;s been almost 1 year with this phone and still this phone superd the only problem is the update asus please push update security patch update is needed .
some lag it &apos;s obvious almost 1 year but still great phone keep providing value for money phones thank you .
mike is not working properly
it doesn &apos;t have some extra features. only ram and battery is main key feathers. apart from other. nothing &apos;s new or unique
in time delivery thank you flipcart
the only problem is that there is no pie update
expected full screen images display .
this phone is budget gaming beast .
awsome experience with this phone .
also the good thing of this phone is it &apos;s hardware .
i regularly play pubg on this phone , but the amazing thing is the phone heats less than other phone .
i mean this phone can handle high graphics games like pubg , cod , asphalt 9 , etc smoothly .
i have the 6gb variant .
it &apos;s camera is good but not that much .
i am very happy with the performance of this phone .
more over the battery backup of this phone is awsome .
but my mobile doesn &apos;t give internet access to pc and mobiles when connected with hotspot .
camera needs to be upgraded and there is serious touch issue just using after 10 days .
and the service given by flipkart is also not standard .
recommended not 2 buy and if u want 2 buy u must not buy on flipkart .
horrible experience phone hangs repeatedly .
i loved it it &apos;s been almost 8months i have been using this mobile excellent running till now i hope it would run long last .
no hanging , no battery down , nothing have problem with it
this phone is above average one.camara is not okay.batter is good , an awesome stunning gorgeous device
product observed issue within 1yr .

mobile look is very cool .
you can compare this with mi 7 pro .
network and mic problem
a some few problems , but all of good
best product i have ever bought ( i had iphone 7 plus , samsung galaxy s 7 edge before ) .

camera could have been better , but considering price point it &apos;s good
worth the money and an amazing mobile phone
phone is best but my received phone is 2018 model .
no wary it &apos;s adjusted .
whenever people asked for a smartphone .
i used to refer asus first .
as of now am using this .
i ordered this mobile for gaming purpose .
good one for playing , camera videos .
unique feature in asus is if we speaking in sim1 .
we can able to receive calls from sim2 also .
that &apos;s the main thing i used to buy asus more often
not so good as 6 gb ram , fingerprint sensor not working with smooth touch , press with more force then worked battery awesome and nice back up , overall best mobile. in range of money 12000
value of money nice mobile a asus zenfone max pro 1
thanks for support by flipkart

battery back up is massive
that was one of fastest deliveries i have ever encountered one day delivery .
my wife is using this phone from last 8 months and the overall performance is superb .
direct video call option not provided but can perform video call via whatsapp .
call recording apps to be downloaded for recording calls .
very good mobile on this price range
good product must buy it
nice product value of money.battery backup is awesome
good but finger sensor is not working some time
this mobile is awesome with 6gb ram and 64gb storage and also having wonderful camera. it has a 5000mah battery which is helpful for us .
phone is good but there are no more features .
camera settings , more about display settings , and worst thing is that you can &apos;t take selfie with fingerprint sensor .
you have to download any other app which allow to take selfies with fingerprint sensor .
it &apos;s awesome valuable for money
before 25 day i am taking in this mobile .
present my mobile is not working
i expect more in camera but it &apos;s ok good mobile
unparallel in all aspects in this price range
worst phone ever and worst company .
first 6 months charger problem and next 6 month battery bulging problem .
very nice phone and delivery
happy with the product and running smoothly as of now .
amazing smartphone in such price .
camera is too good .
it lasts almost 2 days .
fingerprint sensor is not working properly and screen also not work properly
awesome phone i love it
overall performance is good .
i had undergone many reviews with this mobile i found no defect in camera its nice clarity is good performance is also good valued for money but only thing i found is display get sctrached very soon without temper
display is very sensitive it got broke i buy recently and i have never expect to have this such kind of display in asus
camera is good battery life is very powerful
good phone with quality
default call recording feature is not available , that &apos;s the problem
very good quality product .
just mind blowing in this price 6gb ram and camera quality unbelievable
one year passed still rockin&apos;
ultimate in budget phones .
very good phone long battry .
i purchased 2 phone .
it &apos;s just amazing experience with flipkart
worst performance , waste of buying
it &apos;s been 15 months since i &apos;ve bought this month .
this review will help you to know how the phone performs in long term .
the battery performance is extraordinary .
with asus charger , you can expect the battery to be charged from 40 to 100 % in 30 mins .
- decent ram performance .
i always ensure to keep cleaning my phone with ccleaner and it helps to keep ram reasonably unoccupied .
there &apos;s minimum lag faced .
putting this review after three months of extensive usage , the asus zenfone max pro m1 is an absolute value for money , at the cost which it is being sold .
the phone is stable , speed and responsiveness is at par , applications and storage is upto the mark for next couple of years .
after using phone for days together extensively , few applications start to perform low , restarting the device does fixes the issue .
it is recommended to restart the device once in atleast 3 days .
you &apos; ll not regret your buy
cemra very bad and slow , bad look
excellent battery back up .
awesome phone at super awesome price .
worth buying if you &apos;re a notch hater like me
everything is good except following : -
no carrier video calling
very good value for money phone overall .
battery is amazing , performance is quite smooth .
the camera lacks 1-2 features , but is quite good .
don &apos;t purchase this mobile , it &apos;s waste of money .
very disappointed using from last 4 months
after using 6 months i didnt find any lag in software and os is updated from version 8 to 9 ( pie ) .
im using phone without tamper glass and till now no scratches at all .
mobile looking is superb .
front and back camera are impressive .
battery is 1.5 days with heavy usage .
if you are heavy game player and online videos watch , surely you wl get 1 day battery .
at this low price 11000 / - ( 6gb , 64gb ) you will get all good specifications .
this one is good at this range , i bought the 6gb ram varient and it is nice , helpful in my day to day life .
good mobiles. thanks to asus team and flipkart team
i do not even have a bluetooth touch screen
awesome phone. great performance. happy and satisfied with it
but weight is high
good product thanks flipkart
this phone is one of failure model. no call recorder at call , no video call , no gallary app , no music app . waste small apps not provided in this phone and also hanging some time
not good but batry life is good
using this device from last one month and i am very much satisfied with it &apos;s overall performance if you &apos;re looking for a best badget phone under this price segment just go for it
6gb ram with stock android , hope atleast better than miui with ads
using it from 10 months approx .
camera quality is average .
fingerprint sensor and face unlock works excellent .
doesn &apos;t hang or lag while playing games .
bought it for 11,699 in sale .
good battery backup with smooth processing .
camera is useless , apart from that , the device is good .
this is one of the best budget mid-range phone : )
the only issue we had was camera .
although it can be fixed , very easily .
also , build 327 is one of the best fota update for using this phone seamlessly .
battery charger problem and quick charger down slowly change mobile
full faltu mobile no camera quality signal is not cover other mobile full signal cover mobile function very bad
great performance and battery .
feature rich and battery saver option is also good as it allows to use mobile data .
finger and face scanning takes extra time to operate
very good performers and battery backup excellent i like this mobile thanks for flipkart andasus mobile phones
i bought this phone oct 2018 .
which have used ever .
nower days battery is very poor performance .
100 % to 0 % within 6hrs .
i made a good decision .
i ordered this product its a trap poor quality
charging is slow by original charger , phone missed the network very frequently without any outing n roaming .
other wise nice product .
have 4g connectivity issue .
this phone is wrost after pie apdate , charging problem , network problem , gcam is not available , lag in pubg , camra is ok ok , screen britness is very low , sound is low .
i suggest you dont buy this fhone in any case you have many other good option in this range .
camera , internal memory is good .
only one problem i can &apos;t connect my 5g wifi connect only 2.5ghz wifi
value for money in every respect .
though with the comparison of camera with other devices camera needs to be improved
network problem comparing other phone not come signal network issue , i checked put sim another phone network good but this phone is not good for network .
super mobile and very fast delivery
overall performance is also good .
some issue with play 4k video
best battery backup and best phone in this price
don &apos;t buy asus products ( especially the max pro series ) .
there are many bugs in max pro m1 and till date asus hasn &apos;t fixed those and they came out with max pro m2 .
just check out youtube videos .
there is no point in having good specs when there are so many bugs and no capability / support from asus in fixing them .
nice phone by asus but if you are going for its dual camera so i suggest you that it &apos;s not that good in camera but if you are searching a phone for gaming then it &apos;s a very good phone
good mobile battery good .
i &apos;m really happy thanks flipkart . guys buy now u won &apos;t regret it &apos;s 100 % good enough .
and fast flipkart delivery thanks for flip kart
great for heavy users and gamerzzz
this is very good mobile to use , its working fine for me last 9 months and no issues as of now .
some times i need to restart the device , but otherwise its fine .
but the camera quality is not so good compared my previous mobile samsung gallaxy j7 pro .
and also i am unable to landscape mode of camera images , its always portrait .
this is bug with this mobile .
for the cost i paid probably this is good value for money mobile .
is a outstanding phone .
i recomended to all buy this one
typing slow in every after 1 n 2 hour
but phone cam is bad
excellent mobile phone , value for money .
not much features available in the system .
found difficult to switch from lenovo to asus .
asus zenfone max pro m1 is good phone but the phone i received has some issues just after 1 month it &apos;s speakers r not working properly will i get replaced
west phone don &apos;t any one this phone
nice phone at this price everything is good
head set is missing
your products is best products
dont just buy this crap. i dropped my phone from just 3 to 4 feet and its display got completely broken. i am totally disappointed with this product .
best in this price as compared to any chinese xomi etc .
battery to awesome hai aur speed like bullet .
and best part is it is tiwanese made in indonesia .
so quality is also excellent .
its absolutely value money. but some times the screen dosent work. rest all good
all over nice .
overall good phone in this price . .
call recorder is not supporting this phone
this phone is gets heated and very very slow charging , infact the previous one is very good took 2 hours maximum to full charge but this one is worst
and m not expected this kind of product from flipkart so will returned it
no 1 quality nd quantity
its ok actually. facing touch problem with the lock finger print. iv to press it hard to unlock
best phone under 15000.value for money. you should must buy from flipcart
must buy product but the seller is worst .
thanks to flipkart for fastest services i got it same phone in showing the image.but after using month it &apos;s charger is not working but contacting asus solved the problem and charger got replaced
good quality product at this price range
touch is very bad , fingerprint sensor some time not working , worst performance after android 9 update .
i am using this mobile from last 7 month and its still functionaling smoothly .
battery backup is really awesome .
i &apos;m really very much impressed .
not upto mark , as compared with lastest technology
if you want a mobile that covers almost all the required key features needed for a regular smartphone user you can go for this mobile
13 mp back-8 mp front camera
dedicated sd card slot
after one month phone will be off automatically when you use for some time internet .
# worth of money
• camera captures great pictures in day light
• battery performance in not up to mark
it &apos;s draining too fast after 3 months uses
• gaming performance is good as enough
am using this product for the last 3 months and its worth for the money

not giving speed for internet
not bad value forthe money
everything is fine but
there is a lot missing in the mobile
very nice product , value for money with excellent performance
frequently hang and switch-off .
best phone under this price range .
using it from last 3months without any type of issue .
overall best in the price range .
it &apos;s been more than a year
lacks slightly in terms of camera , lacks a lot in terms of fingerprint scanner , everything else is great , love using it , i &apos;m not gonna complain about the camera because i installed google camera in it so it took way better photos and even with raw .
and the performance is good and 6gb ram is good for multitasking .
but take good care of the battery thing .
actually i got this for my frd and the battery got exploded last week due to overcharging i guess .
but i have the 3gb ram varient and i have no problem with it .
blue tooth connectivity issue and some of the apps can &apos;t install and no auto call recording
received quickly and its working till date
very happy with the product
good phone , battery is too good
after one year there is some sort of display problems you will notice but its actually not display problem it is software problem as well as glass is not for those who have oily hand or sweaty hands
phone is pretty much good for the price it &apos;s a deal
good phone at this price
battery excellent but camera average
in this price segment you will get that much only .
satisfied with the product
touch screen very poor not working properly
call quality is that great .
every thing is prefect , some update needed because native vedio calling not supported on any 4 g network .
worst phone i had ever bought , 6gb 64gb variant worst updates company provide , too kuch hanging issue , i think its not just phone &apos;s issue its overall asus mobile issue .
never buy a asus phone
process in not good
good offer and value for money
full marks to battery backup .
camera is good too .
neither heating issue with battery nor hanging issues .
needs regular updates otherwise give issue
4 month used.very well performance
it &apos;s was very much nice product in india because i love asus products all i am fan of asus yes believe me
super phone nice photo
it is very good mobile set because it gives you 5000 mh battery backup which can go up to three days with normal use , and with exhaustive use it can go up to one and half day .
awesome experience will suggest this phone if you have a low budget within 12000
play store is not working
this product is very good product but the pie update is future ad is not work in future work i satisfied only in this future product .
very nice phone i am very happy .
camera have to improve
best as in cost range
expect camera everything is good
value for money as i bought it for 12500. good battery lasts nearly 10 hrs of continuous usage .
good performance even after 1 year .
sound problem is major problem .
terrific - good mobile - value for money
no gallery app - preinstalled
the finger sensor has stopped working in this device so soon .
initially it was wow .
since the vibration was enabled , whenever it was touched , it either unlocked or vibrated .
but now , it doesn &apos;t respond .
so it seems like a hardware issue but that makes it comparatively difficult to use .
otherwise everything else is great
which means perfect for everything
brightness it &apos;s too low n battery also going down soon.not satisfied
good product at medium / low budget .
i got the phone in good condition but , this product didn &apos;t prefer headset.why ? ? ?
used product for 3 months now .
already had to perform a s / w reflash since phone was not unlocking .
and the finger print scanner is already not detecting as required .
the software crashed during update and it is an average product
don &apos;t buy this mobile company lie to all ppl they not give you any security updates for this mobile this just box that you carry for receive call pathatic mobile ever i seen
phone screen broken in just one week and speaker damaged in 7 months
phone is awesome. the battery backup is so long. i lky this phone in this price . 24hours delivery
overall it is a good gadget .
i am loving it .
simply satisfied a lot , i use mobile a lot for my daily office uses and other normal usage .
after my heavy usage battery remains for 2 and half days , for normal usage it lasts for 3 to 4 days without any compromise .
camera as expected because we cannot expect dslr quality from mobile camera .
gives me decent touching experience and mobile performance .
i can say best in range and perfect smartphone for power users .
9 update made my phone flawed with many features .
very competitive product , needs more improvement in camera quality and performance as well .
it &apos;s a decent phone with a low budget .
i had already use asus zenphone 2 and lazer in my family members .
asus hardware has good quality .
asus need to be more agressive for stable update .
what super experience from this phone
back camera quite good , but in low light it is totally bad and flash light is not so powerful , front camera ( 16mp ) not so good
nice packing , on time delivery from flipkart .
received in time . looks good will share my views on this phone once use for some weeks
not a good product .
i have waste my money .
fingers touch lock not working after 3 days of purchase .
battery life not like expected .
lot of applications i had to download where in other phones these come with default in built .
overall best phone under 11k. we cant expect more or compare with other brands. performance is good. slim n stylish n looks premium .
such a best phone ever
asus zefone is very good bettry quality is going on 24 hour
killer of note 5 pro
best phone in this range , loved stock android experience and hardware .
to good mobile battery problem
really nice mobile in budget
for novice it might be tough as no apps or pre installed features are there but it is ideal for customisation .
it &apos;s upgraded to pi so now has screenshot icon which previously was missing .
good for daily use
ram management system is not good
best in its range
worst phone and poor replacement policy by flipkart
it showing 6gb ram but working like a less 2gb ram speed 100 % failure mobile .
the product is enough decent according to it &apos;s price , but i am facing some charging issue sometimes it takes more then 6 hour to charge , and sometimes it take only 3 hours , overall ok
good for this price
good one not better than mi note 7 pro
after 6 days handset speaker automatically off .
after 1 month charger didn &apos;t worked .
there is no garranty of this product .
repair stores not easy available .
flipkart customer care refused to return this product .
asus india customer service number didn &apos;t worked .
i was very disappointed with this .
sound quality is not good as expected .
felt the vibration on the backside of the phone while playing music
phone camera is exactly as it &apos;s claimed , but sometimes get hanged after 9.0 update .
phone &apos;s performance is good , battery life is good .
but native video call feature not available .
display was damaged within a week .
phone was fall down with in 2 feet and it got broken
there are no words to say about this mobile , its simply waste
very poor mobail and very bad battery
good phone under 15k. i love this device

its a good phone i like it
battery backup is good but its not giving that much compare to 5000mah
nice mobile battery is good
the very first word for this phone is &quot; awesome &quot; .
it &apos;s a big jaw breaking badass phone for other companies who is taking high prices with less specifications .
camera- too good .
processor - mind blowing .
body material - high quality plastic material .
sound quality - no phone can beat it .
overall - a perfect mid-range smart phone in budget .
superb phone over all at this budget
excellent phone for the cost it sells .
high end configuration for a low cost and stock android is icing on the cake .
a big fan of asus phones , perfect phone for rough use , using asus phones since 5 years .
tried many models , now at present our whole family is using this product ( asus zenfone max pro m1 ) totally there are 4 handsets of same model in our home .
really good phone but i don &apos;t like it &apos;s camera

this glass is not strong , it simply crack in 2weeks

2 ) i brought this product because of 5000 mah battery but it drains very quickly , i don &apos;t know why .
3 ) another thing is 6gb ram but it hanged 5 times in just 3 days on very normal use after i received it .
this my use experience

great ph in this prize range
over all good. but screen touch is not smooth .
not good low performance.call qwality poor
very good battery backup .
but some cons i feel are position of headphone port at bottom of the phone which is odd and uncomfortable .
touch sensor sometimes takes time to recognise .
to take screen shoot two different buttons need to press together ( asus brand phones having same problem ) it is problematic .
good product. and good performance .
nice but need camera improve
this mobile is not working well .
from yesterday it can &apos;t open after purchase of 12 days , like dead .
more than expected in this budget .
super and value for money
great product . value for money .
excellent product and service
no battery draining or heating issue .
looks and grip is good but camera is not acceptable and also facing lagging problem in playing pubg .
if you &apos;re a gamer then it &apos;s not for you but if you &apos;re average user then go for it .
poor quality , don &apos;t by this cell phone
not an intelligent mobile. good in terms of hardware only .
good but camera average
1 ) front camera is worst
3 ) battery backup is superb but take too many time to charge
average product not bad
good phone but feature of phone and it is not totaly value for money or buyer , no resale value , ( more things are to improve in asus phone ) like
in setting . , camera , in changing it as to be fast , body of the asus phone is not good , improve that
battery 5000ma is very excellent but changing
the most important chance as to do in
i used this phone for 6 month .
i faced many problem that irritate me .
if i restart my phone then the phone screen touch failed and not working .
speakers sound getting low and low.portait mode of this phone is not working.so you don &apos;t buy this phone you go for realme and redmi but not it .
this phone has a good camera quality account to the price of the phone nd the display of the phone is excellent .
sound quality is also very nice .
acc to the price the phone is good
i am not recommend
good phone in this range
awesome battery back up
sound quality is also very good
charging speed is good
gaming is very good but below 20 % battery level the game starts lagging .
i recommend not to buy because its made date is 2017 so its quite out dated phone
good worth for money
using since last 8 months , no doubt a good phone , no issue , everything is good .
only con about this phone is it &apos;s display glass .
within 2months of buying it broke just from 1 mtr fall since not a gorilla glass .
ota updates are on time .
so far received 5 updates with latest android pie security update .
battery is best in this category .
one full charge gives me one and half day of heavy usage and more than a week of standby
price drop , camara performance very low
very glad to see this phone , but the offline video call is not supported . needs to work on that .
a very great product as per its priceing .
am very satisfied with it .
finger sensor isn &apos;t good .
it starts troubling after three months , otherwise ok
can have been made more better the phohne does have good theme but contain &apos;s a good value money
there is problem with camera only otherwise phone is good in his price
many times hanging without any reason
very bad performance of flipcart and product also .
suddenly phone display came out .
don &apos;t waste your money here
overall good despite the camera
- this is a very nice mobile in terms of quality and stability .
- have seen so many negative reviews on pie upgrade but i didn &apos;t face any issues after auto upgrade .
my suggestion is , kindly check for updates available for your mobile ( be it any mobile ) and just update them only .
don &apos;t follow any other links and mess up with your phone
- purchased 6gb model and very happy about the decision .
- it would be great if we get next android upgrade ( q ) as well .
i request you don &apos;t buy this phone because i sell the phone after use for months in olx 4000 rupees .
audio speaker and mic sound very poor quality.some time handset hang.camera quality is not good .
very nice phone thank you flip cart
good phone ; worth for money
it &apos;s a killer phone in such a nice price range .
it runs buttery smooth with 5.61 gb of ram , 64 gb of rom , android 9.0 pie ( got automatically upgraded from 8.1 oreo with a single software update ) and off course with its massive 5000 mah battery .
i was using an asus zenfone max zc550kl since september 2016 and i &apos;m really spellbound with their awesome technical standard and user experience .
overall , it &apos;s a brilliant product in such a price range .
best camera good color excellent screen
nice product.i am using two mobile and one laptop after one year but asus product is not problems .
this smartphone does not even have slow motion feature .
good mobile as per mony , screen short short cut not available
used to work good.now the batteries drain fast
i have enjoy amazing gaming experience with this phone .
camera is a beast. detail in every picture are awesome . 5000mamp battery. good processsor .
amazing. this is my 3rd asus phone .
great value for money
overall not satisfied with this product , it is lacking many useful features which are available on other mobiles .
best phone in this price range. u have to compromise a little on camera. rest all is awesome. install gcam for camera ( wonderful app ) since stock cam isn &apos;t upto the mark
low price low quality product
no good support by asus .
never buy any asus product , warning you all
because i am using it and had very bad experience .
very slow , bugy , unstable os , etc .
and forget to providing the software updates .
after &quot; stable pie update &quot; the phone is now in its poorest condition full of bugs and to many hardware related problems such speakers sound very distorting and ringtone is not audible etc .
addon : -cmp plan service is also very poor .
happy with flipkart shopping
battery goes almost 8 to 10 hrs ( after 100 % charge )
not fast charging as i expected
display size and clearity is good ( if you are thinking for pubg it &apos;s good option )
6 gm ram working good
android 9 updated ( asus gives you update in timely that &apos;s i like )
issue which i face - sometimes network issue occurred signal dropped , call cut not working after updating , can &apos;t able to take pictures camera issue after update
good phone with excellent battery back up and performance at this budget price
performance and price wise phone is excellent.when it comes to stylish look and asus ui its not trendy i would say .
very basic phone , camera quality not up to the mark. not very user friendly. not even call recording option like basic feature of smartphone. would not recommend to purchase asus
nys phn fr price
voice is not clear
waste phone phone is hanging
very bad data cable it &apos;s not charging .
it takes 4 hours to charge 50 %
worst mobile with stock rom , please don &apos;t buy it .
good performance , never faced any lagging issues !
fingerprint sensor is good , face unlock works well !
camera performance is worst , battery performance is okay but charging time is too long , coz of 5000 mah battery with slow charging !
gaming performance is good in pubg , but facing some issues in mortal kombat x !
biggest problem is network issue , most of the time i couldn &apos;t get calls !
best phone under this price works smoothly
battery is giant. bt other features are not so good. i have an issue with its gorrila glass it has been damanged for the first tym.also there is only a showroom to repair in india as per asus website .
i gifted this phone to my brother and he like it. this phone is amazing. i am totally satisfied .
there are some problem . !
the mobile is not charging fastly
phone is good night photo is not good
fast service in flipkart
getting hot a little bit some time bt overall good phone
used 8 to 9 months experience
overall good mobile but speaker issue started after few months of usage
this is the best budget mobile and value for money. awesome performance
nice set of asus world .
i bought it for the hope of good performance but eventually it becomes hung .
poor fingerprint sensor , needed to be reset after just a month of usage .
few bugs in the software , caller screen not displaying ( again , after a few months of usage ) .
super and its smooth to use .excellent one
very good mobile of
awesome phone love it
the google assistant voice model is not working .
camera features are not good
when incoming call is came my mobile was suddenly struck and lift icon is not working and also some time when i captured a picture it &apos;s not captured
phone has become slow compared to the new one . and also there are some technical issues
after the system upgrade . phone is in headphone mode even when i don &apos;t use .
need assistance or upgrade to fix it .
best phone under 12,000 from asus .
really it &apos;s battery is just like huge mammoth which never settle down easily .
in terms of camera it &apos;s good , gives nice picture quality even in low light .
it , s jooming quality is also very good.i think this asus brand will goona wins the hardship race from redmi in few months for sure .
great phone is this price segment. and the battery life is just awesome . overall great mobile phone !
very nice mobile it &apos;s quality also nice
excellent product and its performance
i think everything is good except the camera
, camera is just ok .
under 15k budget i feel like its a good phone .
asus could have given a fast charger that as nowadays its a genuine thing .
very good phone in budget .
super fast delivery from flipkart
wifi feature is very week comparatively to others .
camera is not as good as what company has explained
perfect handset in this price range. no more options in this price .
very nice product , but selfie camera not so good
the phone was so amazing that someone stole it within 3 days
nice phone . good value for money
fantastic fast phone in this budget .
love flipkart for fast delivery and asus for such an excellent phone .
battery and camera performance is pathetic .
doesn &apos;t even last for 12 hours with data on .
this is my 2nd zenfone max pro m1
i love this powerful mobile
my 1st is 3 gb and 32 gb
and 2nd is 6gb and 64 gb
i am using realme 3 pro but max pro m1 is king
very nice product. battery life is awesome
phone is good but late delivery
good product value for money .
superb phone battery 2 day
battery life was not as quoted .
big screen but while watching videos only uses 75 % of screen to cast , very disappointed .
sometimes camera won &apos;t open otherwise picture quality are good .
fingerprint sensor do not work sometimes .
phone is nice and worth of buying
thanks for the 5000mah battery , but beware of the design which does not stick to the people
very good phone with better features but lacks basic camera settings. the camera has many problems like non focus , non working of eis , low light photos are grainy .
hd videos / photos in day light are better .
battery is as always one of the finest functioning component .
gives full day with heavy usage .
screen isn &apos;t great as the reading mode is not available hence using at night may harm your eyes .
i am regular user of the phone and don &apos;t play any games on it .
very nice , worth buy
at android 8.10 it was perfect , but after updating to android 9.0 the display became so dim that before i used 10 % brightness now for normal use i have to use above 50 % brightness , so more battery is consuming .
not at all recommended for the update .
osm products battery back up best i like it.thx flipkart .
in the pie update , they &apos;ve fixed various issues .
so i &apos;d say go for it .
according to the price. the phone should be more expensive.i &apos;m extremely thankful for this phone. don &apos;t think much just go for it
awesome mobile. bought for low price .
no video calling option .
need help of third party apps. not satisfied
battery backup is awesome .
asus zenfone max pro m 1 is an amazing smart mobile phone .
it &apos;s battery backup is absolutely excellent .
camera , sound , and picture quality are pretty good .
ram management is also good .
ratan malik , a certified buyer from shyamnagar , north 24 parganas .
the battery power is superb. the display is fascinating. but one thing. the camera is not up to the mark .
asus team should look into the camera issue. otherwise. the phone is worth the money. love it .
this is the best phone in this price range .
voice , camera , battery all excellent
it is the best quality of smartphone .
it is fabulous .
it is the best product for gaming and photography and storage too .
i love playing pubg with this cool smartphone .
sar value is the advantage .
but speed is low
great camera and awesome game performance , good battery life
worse camera , can &apos;t play heavy graphics game like pubg n all other
wrost product not value for money .
worst phone ever used .
good product by flipkart
value for money compare with other brands , performance , battery , camera everything is good but the problem is network ishu .
this mobile receiving less signal strength so many times call drop network ishu will occur this is the main reason .
no flash when camera is on .
no record call feature on call receive .
good performance and battery life .
not that good camera .
value for money mobile
mobile battry not working after 5 month
not come to the range of redmi note 6 pro redmi is best
as expected. very good i ordered it in 2019 and it was running well. no hang , software update monthly. and well this can make the phone challenging. in 2019
asus max pro m1 worth in 2019
good product to buy for this budget
amazing ph in this budget .
auto updated to android v9 .
battery is good last for 2 + days with data .
overall i don &apos;t regret to buy this product .
the product is still good even after a long year gone by .
battery backup is the biggest plus on this device , it will last one and a half day four sure if you are a person who does medium gaming , internet usage , etc .
the back camera is pretty good , but the front camera has always thebeauty mode on even after turning it off .
the front camera is actually good if the bug is solved .
i don &apos;t have any complaint regarding its perfomance .
it is definitely a veey good device .
best phone beast battery beast .
all features in one smartphone , best price , strong performance
i love this handset .

but little drop in camara side .
little drop in camara
both media and call sound 1uality is pathetic .
i don &apos;t know i long i &apos;ll regret choosing this phone over note 5 pro .
the only thing which drove me to bend towards this piece was the ram , and the trusted brand name .
ram never came to its full use .
moreover , the non gorilla glass broke in just a feet drop .
the screen becomes inactive most of the time .
and many more cons .
not in a mood to write them down .
worst phone i have ever used
happy with the product .
i have raised the problem and their product quality is worst .
their service is more worst to solve the issue
one of the best phone
very nice super mobile
nice and good product
very good mobile just go for it
it &apos;s a 90 % value of money .
has a descent camera .
but stovk camera application is not good .
only a little heating compared to other phones .
using 6gb varient for last 2 months .
best camera in this price range
good. value for money
i was not a big fan of asus android phones but this one is really awesome
the best piece you can get at this price
the product has heating problems and it gets heated up quickly while casually using it , when charging .
the device is not responding like a 6gb ram phone and the finger print sensor is very slow.problem in connecting wifi .
it will disconnected several times and take long time to search wifi network low wifi connectivity if i doesn &apos;t get replacement or refund definitely will take these scammers to consumer court .
lots of cost cutting to make fool of consumer
phone is very bad and issue with software update
camera quality not good .
insurance only software update don &apos;t take insurance .
awesome phone and i like its performance so much .
wow i love this phone
after using for 8 months device is malfunctioning
i have been using asus mobiles for past five years .
they are seamlessly superb .
the hardware configuration that they officer is unparalleled .
it is the best mobile in the market right now .
other brands dont even come anywhere close .
the camera quality after the pie update has gone down. not good .
over all the phone is good just superb
awesome phone in the range .
the battery gives upto 2 days with normal usage .
but there is lot of battery drain when not using it , hope asus will fix it soon !
1 year no problems yet amazing purchase &amp; lt ; 3
but here in this ram does not show in settings .
in it there is some issue in finger print scaner and little bit of hanging problem
awesome for gaming and other stuff but not up to par for photography .
best at it &apos;s price .
the worst product with the worst flipkart portal , defective product seller
diverted the issue and close the problem by themselves .
flipkart implemented the cheap technique to close the customer complains .
i m regular user of other portals , but they are comparatively very bad
it was working fine till one month from the date of purchase but now facing some issues , like touch not happening , unable to see installed apps and post restart the mobile its shows .
options to be improved like mi
phone crashes a lot
charger stopped within 3 months
rest everything is ok
nic product , best battery backup , but camera and finger print sensor are too bad .
good quality worth of money
camera quality is not better
camera quality very bad after download gallery
this cell has nice battery power and it is long lasting
battery charge capacity is low as the given. its only getting 3500 mah battery capacity. average product. i like to exchange my product .
superb phone and happy
the item received was packed properly and delivered as promised .
happy with the purchase .
hmm gud phone while using this one .
nice product sale asus
the review is based on around 7 months usage .
it is very difficult to back up the data .
i am facing problems in backing up the data from mobile to laptop .
sometimes camera stops working and it becomes bit slow .
sound is good display is also good .
sound quality is not good
hardware is not compatible with software
budget phone with more features .
very nice mobile ilov thes mobile
don &apos;t have basic features like dual app and finger print selfie .
same features was there in mi phone which i bought 2 years back .
waste of money for jio users
jio video call is not supported in asus phone
my mobile &apos;s earphones slot is not working and within a period of a week i have replaced my phone because of earphones slot complaint .
and now in the new phone the screen &apos;s touch sensitivity is very bad .
and if i put my mobile in vibrate mode and then if am changing it to loud mode , it is not working .
the ringtone is not coming when am getting a call .
and now am not able to return or replace my phone since it &apos;s already been a month i bought this phone .
please help me to return this phone .
nice phone in nice price
it is a excellent mobile .
it is more valuable for the cost .
it has more specifications
nice product baterry back is good but draining overnight camera is good and performance vice its the best and 5 / 5 value for money
super budget phone .
overall good product but let me tell you some of its pros and cons which i have experienced after 6months of usage .
pros-1 : value for money
cons : avg battery life. doesn &apos;t looks like 5000 mah
2 : camara performance is good in day time. but horrible at night . also it doesn &apos;t have eis .
3. some times it hangs also .
4. fingerprint sensor is bit slow
it has more bug than it &apos;s features .
battery will drain automatically inspite of latest android software with 3 hours of charge time .
camera is below average and picture quality is very poor .
even the screenshot utility is very primitive ( pressing volume and power button for screen shot ) .
if your requirement is long battery life then only it &apos;s worth buying .
don &apos;t buy mistaking it as a smart camera phone and don &apos;t get carried away with the tall claims made during advertisement .
it is absolutely ordinary phone with just good battery life .
not a valued phone .
basic needs are missing in this phone .
like camera quality is bad . , native video calling is not available . , front camera quality is bad .
no any updates about those issues till date from purchased date. asus just making fool to customer .
excellent mobile good battery backup and valuable for money
flipkart delivery was speedy thanks good battery nice camera
good features and more updates but camera to improve mirror image and add dslr features now this generation takeup only camera and fastest speed ram that &apos;s enough
i am writing the review after using this phone for couple of months .
i was looking for a performance phone for quite some time .
dedicated sd card , nice camera ( using google camera ) , good sound quality and amazing battery life are its stand out features .
so finally i can say its a perfect midrange phone for 11000 rupees .
i have received defects mobile phone
flipkart provides the best facility and the quality is amazing
delivery very 1st just amazing
good phone for the money .
but after using it for 8 odd months suddenly touch stopped working had to replace screen as a whole !
mobile to anchoring i think it &apos;s not and that much performance if it &apos;s possible to replacement it &apos;s ok because this is not suit for me in this mobile what i was got it is i think damage
best phone ever . ️
not expect as described
battery drain very fast
don &apos;t buy product during sale season mostly garbage product
this is awesome phone no hang , battery is so long , work with a best ever ram 6gb
value for money smartphone within a tight budget .
camera quality is on par with peers in this range , software ui experience has been a bit let down .
have been facing a few lags every now and then , unworthy of the 6gb ram it has .
pubg is at the second lowest settings and expected some better performance from it .
the gps quality too isn &apos;t the best i &apos;ve seen from phones from this range .
it is avrg phone even having 6gb of ram .
go for 4gb model in other company .
good ram management of ram 6gb veriant .
but no protection for display .
this is only minus point .
i &apos;ve been using this device nearly for an year now its definitely value for money .
i have no software issues .
good value for money almost i &apos;m want to give it 5star
before reading this review , let me first tell you .
it &apos;s been six months since i bought this phone .
and yes this is a beast and most probably the first flagship phone by asus .
the first time it can it &apos;s os was a little bulky but after the march update the zen ui has changed unbelievably .
it &apos;s has really improved from what the so call zen ui was earlier .
having the snapdragon 636 it gives a good ping experience .
it &apos;s a good phone giving more features than expected .
but i think asus need to improve the gui of this cell .
except this every thing is good .
worst phone every time hanging
awesome phone although i ordered it in 15,000 and now it is avail in 9,000 .
but i am very happy with this phone .
phone run for 2 days for one time charge .
wanna go for nice phone go for it blindly .
good and fast delivery
not bad at all
good , but , hanging problem is very little amount
very good mobile in today trends
very good product at its price point and nice work done by asus
lots of reviews are there but then also i &apos;m writing .
if you are looking for a better battery , rough and tough everyday full usage phone , then this is still a better choice than many other devices .
i &apos;ve only one problem with this phone and that is its charging time .
this mobile is very very good mobile supper
using since last 7 months .
no problem at all
product is good. but not perfect. too much bugs .
this is a defective piece .
i need to replace it with any mobile under 12000 rupees.those who can help please reply
my front camera shows a black dot on my mobile screen , so i am very disappointed
, very nice phone
it &apos;s really an awesome phone but it will be better if it &apos;s full display from all sides .
fast delivery and also nice and smooth to use this mobile .
i ordered black colour but i received blue colour .
charging is very speed low .
some time not charing .
i have purchase in nov 2018 , memory , battery backup , screen quality , camera , all are gud as per price band .
i have purchased 10500 , no another cell come in these feature with that price .
camera n quality good
good smart phone ever.value for money .
the delivery too fast and the delivery boy &apos;s behaviour is too good , thank flipkart
great phone but without gorilla glass .
according to camera back cam is superb whereas front cam is bad selfie pple gets upset with frnt cam. it is best gaming mobile . 6gb ram. face unlock is somewhat lagging everything is ok at this price .
worst phone with 15000 k in the planet asus going down with new device
finger print unlock is erratic , works at time and does not : (
bad phone every moment getting hang no proper updates
good but need more options
i m enjoying this phone as follows 1 best battery 2 best camera performance 3 best gaming performance 4 best operating speed 5 best price
good mobile tq flipkart
worth for money. go for it. amazing mobile
battery to be improved
except camera everything is rocking
camera should have been better than what it is .
phone heats up a bit while charging.sometimes the charging speed is very slow which is really annoying.i have to unplug the charger and put it again to get to normal conditions .
i don &apos;t understand what &apos;s the problem behind it .
these are some of the issues for me .
otherwise its a great buy at this price .
would have given 4 had i not faced these issues .
using it for last 6 months. had a nice experience with the phone .
performance with good battery backup is a plus for it .
killer combination with sd 646 octa core . aswm phone , value for money .
the phone is old version like 2016 models .
use aap with deta for make video call .
very nice product me very happy .
time on delivery .and product perfect .
complete wast of money. bad quality of camara. even not able to attend phone call. finger sensor not working. eco coming at speaking time. even not able to install apps. wast mobile
awesome price and brand

i love this camera
awesome phone. front camera must be improved otherwise best mobie
after andoriod 9pie update all function has been working very smoothly but battery not improved and you don &apos;t play pubg hd mode after update 9 pie .
camera quality is very bad from starting , battery charging and backup was very good but after pie update charging time too long and draining very too much first , and touch screen also not working properly some time .
osm in every aspect
good but camera is not good
i received mobile with low camera quality
this phone is good but as shown in the product details the display size is only 5.5 inches but not more than 6 and i can see this mobile is hanging even though it &apos;s having 6 gb ram .
not able to upload pics in insta and whatsapp as the photos are not able to view .
so better not to buy if you don &apos;t want to loose money .
please dont buy this phone i bought 8 months back and now the charger is completely dead
good phone waiting for pie update
good performance and battery
camera both front and back not good , except camera good value for money , good battery life
it is so nice .
most of the time phone hangs during calls .
camera abruptly shut and pixel quality as not up to the mark .
poor response from flipkart while to they arrange a call from their executive who supposed to come for shorting out the issues .
executive didn &apos;t come yet now .
phone hangs a lot .
its been 7 months snd the screen has blacked out .
best phone in this price range
awesome gadget in minimum amount. thank you fipkart
good phone at this range specially it &apos;s ram 6gb amazing
phone is good. battery backup not so much good . 5000 mah battery gives you 6 hours rough and tough backup. after that. dead
v good phone , i have bought it 5 months ago its performance is good till now , its 6gb varient have better camera and its battery is awsm
one of the best things i &apos;ve ever done !
best phone in this price range works well no lagging after hard useage of phone at end of the evening ( atleast 8 hours by my opinion ) battery remains about 30 percentage .
the best part from this phone is stock android .
but you need to consider before buying asus phone it &apos;s display glass is thin there are more chances to break by falling from minimal height because this one and my older asus zenfone also met the problem
good but auto call recording not in this mobile
have been using a lenovo 3gb ram .
never got hang with my use .
asus is having default app crashing issues and hanging issues .
the phone is 6 gb ram .
if i had a chance i would have returned .
i &apos;m really trapped now .
very good mobile phone
its the value of money .
excellent phone , but front camera is not so good
have bought the phone a week before .
very nice phone and cost effective range .
great product in the price range .
received on time .
best of the best
data speed meter can &apos;t be seen .
2. selected area is not getting screen shot .
whole page is getting screen shoted .
3. problem in bluetooth and cast to tv every time .
charging not doing fast .
don &apos;t buy this product waste of your money
after using few days provide the comments , hearing sound is slow , overall sound quality is not good , battery took longer time to recharge .
battery performance is good and once charging is full then battery almost survive 1.5-2 days. this is too good .
display and camera is ok. after few months of use i found phone get hanged , after swithoff / on then it works again .
over all not satisfied with the phone also not recommend to buy this phone .
its camera is not click nice photo some time
very bad already used mobile
the charger i got not functioning even , just 2 months passed .
i need the replacement immediately .
i contacted customer care many times .
i think i am cheated .
how can i charge my phone ? .
i lost my money , i lost my valuable time .
very one. worth of money .
this is so good mobile and it &apos;s price also very low
i am using this since 6 months .
performance wise it is very good that too with the price we are getting .
it has good camera quality , battery life .
if you have used samsung and other phones , it is little difficult to use in the start , else its amazing .
even with buggy stock rom works well but camera is worst in this price range
iam first time i purchased asus mobile
ram and speed excellent
dont buy this mobile you want to buy asus zenfone max pro2
excellent phone but exchange facility is not worthy
overall the phone is good .
but there are many cons also .
the finger print sensor is very slow compared to other phones in this price also it stopped working don &apos;t know for what reason .
battery backup is not up to the mark .
overall its a great value for money .
front camera and gorilla display need to improved
sim 2 often looses network , have to turn sim 2 off and then on , it then catches network .
not having with battery back up of 5000 mah , only 1 day support .
touch key press makes the phone vibrate .
after using 6 months and updating to latest version .
1.screen brightness display is very bad
3.while talking in another call sometimes sensor is not working it will come in black screen .
there is no live wall papers .
there is no call recording option .
camera is not up to mark .
there is no much options. bad options
camera is not good over all nice
good one. except camera everything is fine. worth for each and every penny .
good locking good performance
my purpose of buying this phone was because i wanted an excellent battery and sound / audio and microphone , but on all these three fronts the phone has let me down .
hope my observation will be taken a seriously by the expert team at asus and will gift me a phone which caters to my needs mentioned above .
pathetic phone and pathetic service
very good smart phone .
i got this mobile in september 9th .
i &apos;m using this mobile from september 10th to till date , so it almost 8 months completed .
i didn &apos;t get any issues yet .
i got best piece without damage .
camera quality is good .
battery is also good performance for me .

heavy perfomance at this price superb
good quality for use but camera upgrade .
awosome product good battery amazing camera
overall , i &apos;d say the quality that asus once stood for has indeed declined .
- there are multiple software glitches
- while talking , the microphone doesn &apos;t seem to work properly as the other person can &apos;t hear me clearly .
we tried using a different mobile network operator but the issue still persists
nice product but is not showing ram and gallery
nice in this price range
mobile is awesome for rough use .
the main thing is after a few months it &apos;s hard to unlock mobile through finger print .
not as expected , battery is running out faster .
display not vivid and rich .
shouldn &apos;t have gone for this .
camera alone looks to be acceptable .
after 2weeek i found that it has more trouble with its camera .
after recording it can &apos;t play the video properly , video is being played in slow motion .
i just lost my money and trust on flipkart .
fine product for this money
i am happy and statisfy
it &apos;s been almost half a year and the phone works perfectly for all my purposes including taking pics , great network reception , playing high end games using hd graphics , quick navigation etc
yes very nice product price worthy , just the camera is not awesome but good .
i was using mi mobile , when comparing with that inbuilt app are less .
ui are having very limited options
camera is too bad . don &apos;t buy
battery is coming up to twenty hours only .
rest all ( display , camera and processor performance ) are very good .
very very nice and beautiful salim mobile phone .
true value for money .
you must know how to operate camera settings .
good camera with this less money
super phone looking good
loudspeaker not working properly on calling , charging adopter failed with 20days of its purchase .
product is absolutely worth. but the problem i faced was in the case of getting it delivered on time
it &apos;s almost a month now and still no fault yet
so in my opinion go for this one but it will take a while to get back to yourself up
nice mobile. fast delivery. no problems .
phone is very good
super product and worth of money
battery is too good. but overall finishing of the product is better in max pro m2
it is a good product , but suddenly after updation it behave oddly .

best gaming mobile in this budget range
it &apos;s been more than 1 month of usage and i &apos;m sure this is one of the best under 15k even better than new realme or redmi mobiles .
it has top notch processor which do justice with 4gb ram and give smooth performance in every scenario .
in 1st week ram management is not that good but after update this problem is resolved .
camera is good enough .
battery backup is awesome if u r moderate user u get more than 1 day battery life and when u play heavy games you will have to charge it at day en .
cam is good .
battery drains fast .
display ok .
vdo call will be available only after update of around 7gb .
i got it delivered in just one day that was awesome service by flipkart .
now talking about the device-1 ) rear camera is good in daylight , in low light i found a little noisy and grainy but far better than mi a1 for low light .
2 ) front camera is brilliant specially in portrait mode .
3 ) battery backup is also very good in normal usage it dropped to just 70 from morning 6 to evening 6 . ( no gaming or movie watching ) .
with moderate usage battery lasts comfortably till end of day so missing of fa .
pros-1 . good camera .
2 . premium look and feel .
3 . good multitasking performance .
4 . emui 5 . 1 looks really good .
cons-1 . battery life could have been better .
2 . no fast charging3 . no gorilla glass .

i purchased this phone two years ago .
but still it &apos;s in good condition .
i dropped this phone above 20 times .
but the hard case that i bought helped to keep it damage free .
13 m p camera is good .
battery ( using net ) will go upto 10 hours .
got nougat update .
i &apos;m not a heavy game player , still play small games .
not that much hanging problem .
got vo lte update .
don &apos;t have any touchscreen or display problem .
i got this phone for 8549 / - i &apos;m satisfied with this phone and love using huawei phones .
design and lookwise it is a fabulous phone .
i have bought the golden colour and it looks very attractive and stylish .
the brushed metal body adds to the looks of this phone .
the kirin octacore processor is pretty powerful for day to day tasks , but ram should have been 3gb .
you will get only about 900 mb out of 2gb .
i don &apos;t play heavy games , so i can &apos;t tell about the gaming performance in detail .
but the camera disappointed me a lot .
as i read &amp; amp ; watched so many reviews and many of the reviewer .
awesome phone .
nice slow motion video recording .
smooth ui .
fingerprint sensor works fine .
can lock apps with fingerprint sensor .
very excellent phone
i love honor 8x .
great camera grt performance .
thanks flipcart .
looking great .
and on time delivery .
honor 8x excellent phone
it &apos;s good
gifted to my brother .
he is happy .
honor 8x - black colour pros : - screen real estate more than 6 &quot; - sleek design ( glass on both sides ) and flat - the back camera is actually great for clicking photos ( ai is useful ) and has a lot of funky edits for those that matter .
headphone jack - heavily customizable in the venue of themes - a very fast fingerprint scanner cons : - front camera portrait mode is advisable to not use- a lot of pre-installed apps so it is advisable to install a launcher to hide those apps .

great ! nice camera with blurr background mode
first of all thanks to flipkart for on time delivery and quick refund procedure .
looks : stylish back panel but from front it looks very cheap .
lags during normal usagecamera is good under sunlight but very poor in low light conditions video playback is dull , doesn &apos;t look like a screen with 401 ppi heats ! even during normal usage of 10 minutes , phone heats up around fingerprint sensor area , area around rear camera , near earpiece i &apos;ve returned my honor 5x for the heating issues .
nice mob ! .
1 . display awesome ! .
1080p screen looks great ! .
2 . battery is superb .
can hold fr a day with heavy usage ! .
3 . though it has 2gb ram thr r no lags .
if u r a gamer honor 5x will be a bad choice ! .
there r little lags while multitasking but u dont need to worry , its hardly noticable ! .
4 . metal design is stunning ! .
trust me it wont look like a cheap phone ! .
5 . camera same as honor 4x .
no major diff ! .
except the wide angle lens fr front cam ! .

here is my review post using the phone for 2 days , will update the review in case of any changes observed in the performance .
body ( rating - 3 / 5 ) : reasonable plastic body , does not gives a premium finish however looks good .

display / screen ( rating – 2 . 7 / 5 ) : 13 . 84 cm ( 5 . 45 inch ) display , colors are bright and easy on the eyes , angle view is also good consider .
display is very nice .

no responce from flipkart regarding my hounur 4c mobile .
the mobile was heating and drying battery .
this is my complete review after using 15days of usage : why to take honor 4c ?
( if your having confusion between honor 4c , yu yurekha , lenovo a7000 , m i4 ) - decent touch- decent price with awesome look &amp; amp ; with great build quality- selfie awesome front camera with 5 m p , i &apos;m sure go for it this one reason is enough in this price range .
great ui with great features ( no need for additional launchers , f y i we can &apos;t apply other launchers as default ) - good sound clarity ( no ear phones , ho .
before buying this mobile i have done lot of research and after that bought this mobile .
before buying this 4c my focus was a6000 plus ( lenovo ) but due to many bad reviews in flip-kart i changed my choice its been 1 and half years my mobile still rocks with zero issues .
go for this it is awesome mobile guyzzzokay lets go to the mobile- ordered my mobile on 25 april-received my mobile on 27 april ( fast delivery thanks to flip-kart this is my second product but for my first product they .
if you are budget and camera specific , then this one is for you .
( u p d a t e d 15 . 10 . 2015 ) camera : - rear 13 m p has 1 / 3 . 06 &quot; sensor from sony ( i mx 214 ) , which gives good results than any other phone ( like lenovo a6000,6000plus , 7000 etc ) in this price range .
full h d videos are crystal clear without any staggering @ 30fps and photos in low light are good too .
videos are recorded in m p4 format and not 3gp which is a great advantage .
people should be aware of the image sensor size and not the mega pixel .
pros : 1 . great product in rs8999 / - .
2 . extremely good battery .
3 . butter smooth swipe .
4 . all games running without any lag .
5 . the front camera is very good for selfie .
cons : 1 . heap phone is not in the box .
battery draining issue could be solved by these steps .
1 : update all your apps after receiving the phone .
2 . clear partition cache after updating the apps .
3 : go to settings manage apps all google search force stop the app and then disable it .
4 : restart the phone .
5 . leave your phone for few hours and you &apos;ll notice that the battery drain issue is fixed .
how to clear partition cache . switch of your phone .
hold volume up and power key at the same time .
leave the keys only only the ho .
its an amazing performer under rs 9000 . .
first of all the main pros are :
1- no heating while playing games ( 1hours ) .
2- playable all kind of games without any bit of laggg .
( asphalt 8 , mc4 , dead trigger 2 , nova 3 etc .
) 3- amazing camera , super clarity all lighting conditions ( the rear 13mp sony cam captured pic size is 9mb so the clarity u imagine .
full hd video clarity is also awesome ) ( front cam is 5mp is morethan enough for better selfies .
from omnivision ) .
4-the ram is 2gb but .
i purchased this phone on 10th may and received it on 12th and here &apos;s my review of the phone - this phone is packed with great features for the price , no doubt about it .
however , the problem is with the battery .
i used the phone with 2g network , zero brightness and minimal calls .
absolutely no gaming / facebook / camera usage / gps usage .
they claim the battery to be 2550m ah but it doesn &apos;t even last for 10 hours with minimal usage ! i had to charge the phone twice a day .
i requested for a replacemen .
honor 4c is an excellent phone with a premium feel and easy to use emui interface .
camera is top notch .
call quality is awesomethe phone easily matches with mi4i &amp; amp ; yu yurekabattery backup seems to be good
please don &apos;t buy this mobile battery wont even last 5 hours .
with full chargemoderate / no use battery drains like anything please stay away
good battery backup .
takes time to charge .
very good dual camera that takes perfect photos in outdoor and good light conditions .
poor performance in low light and night photos .
selfie camera could have been better .
storage is more than enough .
display is the best .
emui software is good , has very good customisation .
overall all value for money .
bang for the buck ! best in class camera , smooth user interface but while using camera and v r phone tends to heat up a bit .
hoping to see a fix in future update .
beast phone .
simply awesome in all features .
nicephone , decent battery life , after updating to oreo its good , good camera , phone gets warm while continuous usage .

bought last week , till now working good , nice display , good camera with bright pictures , struggles in low light .
awesome phone .
my search for buying a flagship killer phone ends here .
jak of all trades .
build quality is super ; lots of bloatware but can be uninstalled , phone gets hot while taking photos .
camera quality is the best
i purchased this mobile few days back in an offer and within that price i think i get more than expected .
if you are planning to buy honor mobiles then you will not be disappointed on sound and display side .
i am reviewing it after 10 days of using , i also mentioned some tips about its software update and heating issue at the last so please read that also .
pros : 1 . display : with it &apos;s 2 k display i get eye soothing experience , really love it .

it has very sensitive display to get crack .
i recommend others to do not invest 29k for this one .
the phone &apos;s more amazing than i expected
i am using it from past 1 month .
no heating issues , amazing battery backup .
no lag in the phone .
3g speed i over my expectations .
i would say , you should go for this phone instead of yureka .
the mobile is class apart .
at this price it is simply amazing .
best phone compared lenovo7000 , moto g , red mi 4 , red mi 2 , asus zenphone 5 . pros : - superb camera - both front and rear .
in low light front camera gives very clear natural picture , good for selfies without flash .
build quality is premium quality .
huawie has looked into minor details in building the phone .
scratch / screen card is fitted on the display by default .
no need to buy a separate one .

iam one of lucky person to got limited edition .
its super mobile .
ear phones and power bank is good .
nice mobile in 10 k range
this phone is excellent .
the company huawei has maintain the graphics , battery back-up , style and design .
i think that this huawei honor 4x is definiitely better than samsung , sony , lenovo etc .
i recommend to buy this phone due to this is cost -effective
i ordered honor 4x limited version and i really impressed what i received in box .
its amazing in range of 10 k.
look and feel of phone is analog with i phone .
design of phone is very nice .
battery can survive full day even after full day usage .
camera quality upto mark and gives nice photos .

hats off flipcart .
i orderd at 20 th nite 7 pm and i got this sexy beauty at 21st 12noon .
good battery and good looking alsoo .
working grate .
and the limited version package is .
looking very nice .
go to his mobilee , .
con is no back liteee .
butt screen is very good .
touch = average headphone = below avg speaker = avg rear cam = good front cam = good display = good heat = no heating problem battery = good lagging problem = existfree back cover = = = bad quality plastic . music app paused for half of a sec here n there .
disgusting it is .
f m iw working smooth though .
no in house service center in kolkata ( not sure about another city ) , need to ship the product to claim warranty .
got this inf from a listed service center .
both sims are not 4g lte .
over .
i owned asus zenfone 5 before , but due to battery drainage and average camera i wanted to change .
i wanted a cheap phone because i have already lost 21k htc in public transport .
the alternative i had in mind was xiaomi mi4i but i expected it to heat and battery drain due to software problems and highly dense screen .
they have packed too much in too less a package .
my sister use mi3 but had faced many software related problems like phone going dead for 3 days , automatic key typing on watsapp e .
if you think this device is not worth it , you completely wrong .
stop searching for negative reviews .
writing this review after 28 days of usage .
i &apos;ll update the review if there are any changes .
pros1 . seamless performance , no lag whatsoever so far .
it seamlessly multitasks , picks up right from where you left instantly .

best this phone fichars
recently , i bought this phone for my brother and surprisingly it exceeded all my expectations .
my brother &apos;s requirements were a good camera phone and at least 2gb ram at sub 10k , so my obvious options were narrowed down to redmi note 4g , yureka and honor 4x .
pondering about all other options i opted to go with honor 4x and i wasn &apos;t disappointed with my choice for following reasons .
1. camera is exceptionally well made , being an user of moto x ( 2nd gen ) i can say for sure that this phone has so .
the build quality of the device , its awesome .
great when compared to devices like y u yurekha , moto g 2nd gen and others ( all this devices can eat s.t ) - love the honor devices , good stuff from huawei .
i love the emui , as of this writing i received the update for power optimizing and wifi hotspot and network issues .
all though i never noticed any problem with those .
the display is brilliant and so nice that i haven &apos;t slept for 2 days after receiving the device .
batte .
this is an awesome phone .
best in everything .
at this point in time you cannot get a better phone than this at this price .
emui 3 . 0 rocks , it has themes both like i o s and windows on android platform .
best blend of i o s , android and windows .
final say &quot; go for it &quot; !
i bought this phone after a long comparision .
i reviewed many phones including lenovo a7000 , redmi note 4g .
lenovo a7000 have heating problem ( even on calling , browsing ) , bad camera .
redmi note 4g is a good phone .
but single sim , average camera , 32 bit processor .
now honor 4x .
great call quality .
better camera .
no heating problem .
a phone for those who want an allrounder .
purchased this product after trying for honor holly ( review based on 5 day use ) 1 . great battery life last full day even if use 3g ( today i used it for more than 24 hours stll there is 17 % charge .
i did every thing played video , whatsapp , fb , game , wifi , wifi hotsport ) .
five stars .2 . a beautiful display ( multi touch ) .
five stars .3 . nice rear and front camera .
five stars .4. speaker not so loud .
four star .5 . 4g is there ( but i dont have a 4g sim )
five stars . 6 . 2 gb ram .
i ordered this one in a impression that this would be a better phone as i already have honor .
this one has better configuration hence i was expecting better performance .
so far my observation : battery back up good .
phone look and feel good .
performance for games like coc : i observed slow or stucked graphics while playing coc .
i never observed such problem in micromad a116 . though it had very low config .
touch : not o k you can feel lag while performing operations .
seems its ui itself is adding .
really this review will helpful guys , honor 4x 5 . 5hd screen is too big but watch videos photos are pretty good , india &apos;s first dual 4gsim lte its very fast .
processor quad core no hanging &amp; amp ; heating problem take selfie photos are great quality front 5mp rear 13mp , battery backup for this phone awesome , notification light green colour night time its looking wow .
pros1. water fall laminated h d display 2. dts sound 3 . 4g dualsim ( micro ) 3. cam good quality 13pmp &amp; amp ; 5mp front cons1 . no headse .
i do lot online shopping but dont do much reviews .
but this phone made me write .
specs u already know .
bought it thinking that i use it few days and than give it my mom and will go for mi4 or s5 or any high-end phone .
also after this had bought htc820 but after few days usage got back on it and gave htc to mom .
even i dont believe .
) earlier i have used s4 , sony m2 , s3 neo , iphone 4s and many others .
but this phone has given real satisfation for what money i have spent .
1 ) battery- wifi on all .
i have honor 4x in flash sale on 6 april 2015 . so , its about 1 . 5 month completed of use , still doesn &apos;t found any issue .
played around with my honor 4x and most of time with the camera .
things that i liked : - display quality is good .
but i am not stunned though , as i have see many h d and full h d display .
100 % justification done by honor 4x- lock screen wallpapers .
everytime i unlock , it shows new wallpaper .
the wallpaper selection is very good and there are tons of wallpapers available with .
whatever the phone is average or good or bad working , users will not be happy when there is need to buy accessories separately .
it feels bad when w s retail is making money even with accessories .
thank you flipkart for fast delivery .
gud looking and best phone for midrange users .
pros : camerasoundraminternal memory osgrey colorbattery cons : no headset inside box hybrid slotresult : i bought 2 piece honor 6x to my family within this year .
now 3rd one for me .
i suggest another one to my friend .
he also got it .

&#91; got 10 % off for citibank credit card usage : - ) &#93; , thanks to flipkart for delivering the product 1 day before than expected .
its been 10 days from now that i am using the mobile .
following are the pros and cons : cons : - front cam would have been better .

( music player sound quality is good if you have a good quality ear phone ) .
due to smooth fi .
honor 6 plus is soon gonna be another hit from huawei ! purchased yesterday and i am totally satisfied with it in its 1st impression .
check tech virus youtube channel for unboxing video .
i will use this phone phone for few more days and will update my experience here .
this phone is brilliant when compared to other products currently available at this price .
everything is perfectly designed and superb to use .
awesome phone from huawei !
good mobile i seen ever with great camera &amp; amp ; battery .
working super fast .
battery last for 48hrs with medium use and 24hrs heavy usage .
i really like &amp; amp ; suggest to purchase .
i chose this phone over the likes of many phones like the oneplus one , zenfone 2 . i did a fare bit of research on all the phones available in this price bracket .
cons : 1. a bit overpriced ( no earphones )
2. not a famous phone3. not a famous processor .
pros : except the above mentioned thing everything in this device is great .
the processor is really snappy , ram is more than enough and battery life is great too .
but i really want to point out the build , screen quality and camera , you cann .
very poor quality
hi friends , awesome packing by flipkart but not shipped in committed date .
using this mobile for 2 days and here are some views about this mobile .
pros : design : when u first take this mobile in ur hand , u get an awesome feeling that u r holding a premium mobile bcoz of its elegant design .
display : as its 401 ppi , display is gorgeous .
its just wonderful to see this mobile .
lock screen image changes once every time u press the lock button .
this is something new i experienced and its bea .
i read someone is trying to tell , touch plus option is not working for them and he got a replacement of the mobile .
please know that , touch plus option needs a special screen guard which does not come with the mobile .
you need to buy it separately .
when you have that special screen guard , your controls will work .
dont blame it on the mobile for this .
bought this unique item .
i willn &apos;t go through specification as you people can go through in the mobile description .
first i will go through it &apos;s drawbacks after using it for more than 1 week : 1- huawei needs to make ram management more smart .
sometimes some apps consume more battery &amp; amp ; ram .
2 - although battery is 3600 mah &amp; amp ; normally it uses 1 . 3g h z to handle daily usages still it doesn &apos;t feels having 3600 mah .
it is just better than my moto g2 having 2070 mah as moto gives me 4-5 hrs of conti .
a big thanks to flipkart ! now coming to phone review , man its wow ! it has got almost all the features which a top end phone of 60 k is flaunting and that too lesser than half price .
pros : elegant looks ( black looks sexy ) super fast processing best mobile camera in its range ( nice bokeh effect which means ur subject remains in sharp focus while the background blurs ) nice battery backup ( full day with 3g usage and occasional gaming ) smart user interface zero lagging wireless chargin .
updated after 60 days use . at first i wanna let you all know that this “ honor holly ” is best competitor to moto e , redmi 1s &amp; amp ; even moto g ( if you consider features from pricing point of view ) .
in this price it is offering best in class features with android kitkat , 8 m p rear &amp; amp ; 2 m p front camera , 16 gb r o m , 1 gb ram &amp; amp ; 1 . 3g hz m t quad-core processor .
now i ’ ll brief pros &amp; amp ; cons of this masterpiece .
pros : • nice build quality .
looks like any high-end smartphones .
rear pane .
hey guys this is my review for those who are still hesitating to buy this phone because of &quot; brand &apos; and &quot; price tag &apos; .
awesome mobile awesome camera and flashlight is too good .
flawless performance i have played 3 major games : need for speed m w , asphalt 8 and f i f a 15 , all games are loading preety well and running smoothly .
music quality is above average , what you will not get in micromax .
and one important thing better than xiaomino heatng issue .
don &apos;t think go for it .
if you find my review use .
i received the phone a day after diwali .
kudos to flipkart for making it possible as they had mentioned they would send it by nov.
7th .
now on to review : honor holly ( it comes from an i phone 5 user for years ) i bought this phone for my dad who has never used a touch phone nor has he ever been introduced to the word internet .
under my impression android has always been confusing but kit kat 4 . 4 . 2 supported with huawei emotion interface makes it a cake walk for any beginner to understand a .
got the mobile delivered in two days .
t y flipkart and w sretailer for your speedy delivery .
coming to mobile .
13. x gb of 16gb available- honor holly8gb redmi 1s only 4gb available user memory4gb moto e-only 2. x gb available . display clarity-redmi 1s ( marginal higher ppi ) honor holly ( 720p ) moto e ( fwvga ) . processor- honor holly = redmi 1s ( both quad core ) moto e ( dual core ) . ram-same to all 1gb devices . camera-all cameras are worst in this segment but worth .
comparing the spec with m o t o g 2nd gen , huawei honor holly is good , so am planned to purchase the phone , looking good , black &amp; amp ; white combination is fantastic .
price of the phone is 6999 rs with free transcend 8 gb memory card .
suggestion to flipkart : please provide the screen guards , cases , covers at the earliest of honor holly
hello everyone , i &apos;m sharing my review about this product that hopefully help you making quick decision to purchase huawei holly .
about quality- i feel this cellphone is delicate , thin and light weight with glossy white back cover and decent bright color display .
about software : - thank god , this cellphone does not have extra pre-installed apps except flipkart app .
( because app consume ram space and that really low down cellphone performance and may create heat-up issue .
about hardware : .
firstly would like to tell you that i &apos;m an owner of both the phones .
previously owned redmi but really got tired of the phone and since i coudn &apos;t return it , i also bought a honor holly after taking part time jobs for a month .
also i would like to state that this review is not for purposes acknowledging &apos; which phone is better &apos; .
it &apos;s just a generous review by my experence that i had faced with both the phones and made a final verdict .
before going ahead and taking a &apos; casual &apos; attitude and giving .
i have used moto e , android one , iris x5 and remi 1s .
not exaggerating to say it kills them all .
pros1. great build gives confidence as of the case of zenfone5 . 2. no heating issue unlike redmi , though xiaomi claims heating issue is solved but they still clocks the snapdragon 400 chipset to dangerous frequency of 1 . 6 ghz .
3. a memory card , big screen and a very smooth customized o.s.
on top of kitkat .
4. great camera , although redmi &apos;s camera is clearer but this bsi lens comes very close to it .
5. sm .
hi everyone , i got this product on the next day after my order without any urgent shipping options .
the actual time in between my order and delivery is 25 hours only .
so , i would like to give 1000 stars to flipkart &apos;s service .
no other e-commerce websites can act like these peoples , that much fast delivery .
k u d o s to that .
now , coming to the phone review .
in one word , it would be described as the title i have given .
a trust-able mobile phone within an unbeliev .
i wont go into all the tiny details .
shortly it is as good as moto g if you lie to someone it is a 15,000 or 20,000 rupees phone they will agree .
the looks are too good for a 7k phone .
i was initially reluctant to buy this product because i wasn &apos;t sure about the brand .
i went against my will due to its killer specs it had i also did my due diligence before buying it .
the reviews were extremely positive and they compete against mi4 and it must for a reason i was pleasantly surprised with the phone .
it was butter smooth and the emotion ui is insanely simple to use pros1 . beautiful design2 . super smooth touch3 . easy and simple ui4 . incredible performance5 . long battery .
i was searching all over internet for mobile to buy .
for atleast a month .
although i wanted to buy m i3. it was not available .
during this i found this fone .
after reading the spec .
i found it very awesome .
my friends were pretty skeptical about my decision to buy this fone but i went with my guts and bought this fone on 6th oct.
although flipkart said that it would be delivered by 11th oct.
to my surprised it was delivered very next morning .
thanks flipkart for that .
also my friends .
i have been using this device only for the last 2 days but i am already wowed by it .
i was waiting to get the mi4 , however after reading a lot of blogs from china claiming that honor 6 is better than mi4 in few aspects , i decided to take the plunge .
design : this phone has a great design .
it has a premium aluminium frame and a glass back .
the best thing is the phone feels so light on the hand .
doesn &apos;t feel like a 5 phone in terms of size and weight .
such a pleasure to hold in the hand .
th .
l g , samsung , htc , sony , motorola et al are selling their flagship with high-end spec between 32 k to 45 k rupees .
so when lesser known company like huawei comes with a spec which beats all these flagship phones on paper and costs about half or less than half , then one tends to be suspicious at first .
like me .
i was very skeptical ( especially after reading anand tech review , which i will cover later in this review ) about this phone .
after owning this phone for a week i am converted person .
so , .
ordered it on the bigbillionday and got 1500 discount , thanks to flipkart after months of reading up about honor 6 and a day of actual use , i am penning down a first-hand review , mostly the points which are not covered in other reviews found on the net , hope it helps : b ui l d , quality a n d design • superb fit and finish , good material quality .
feels premium and nice to hold • very light for the size ( around 130gms ) but doesn ’ t feel flimsy at all • narrow bezels with a good percentage of area .
check at bottom for latest comments i have purchased in flipkart on launching day itself , delivered within 2 days ( thanks for quick delivery ) .
i was thinking to go for nexus5 but due to expensive i was unable to go for it and finally i purchased huawei honor 6 h60- l04 which has satisfied me .
pros : 1 . very good graphics2 . more audible volume with provided backside speaker3 . very sensitive touch4 . good battery backup ( on average usage it &apos;s giving more than 24hrs ) 5 . no lagging even with h .
i usually don &apos;t give negative feedback on a product unless it really gives problems .
unfortunately this phone has really disappointed me given the powerful specs boasted by huawei .
i replaced my lenovo p770 with this phone , but huaweri honor 6 has c r a s h e d t w i c e in last 3 months .
first time it crashed just within a month of purchasing .
got a replacement of same product from flipkart .
today again it crashed .
surprisingly it was working fine till evening 8 p m and then suddenly it crashed .
its 9 .
it has 4g and u get free screen guard plus back guard for mobile as free , no headphones included .
honor 6 is the best phone you can get at this price range .
its an awsom phone with cool looks and very good ui .
i am very much impressed with the ui .
once you hold this phone you will surely fall in love with this phone .
just run bechmark on an tu tu and got score of 40327 and bechmark on g e e k b e n c h 3 -3111which is more than good .
good display with full hd good battery life with heavy usage you .
after a few days of using the device , i dropped the device and the front glass broke .
as that was my mistake , i was willing to pay the glass / screen replacement charges .
huawei doesn &apos;t have a dedicated service center .
they direct to third party service center ( hardly a few ) who deal with multiple brands like motorola , htc and a lot other brands .
the one in chennai was over crowded .
on a saturday , wait time to meet the agent was 4 hours and after that long wait they mentioned that it will take .
i was very skeptical about buying a phone that &apos;s new to the market .
i &apos;ve always been a big brand kind of person , but boy was this totally worth it .
i &apos;m so glad android phones have penetrated so well into today &apos;s market .
about the phone itself , look and feel : great build , feels great in your hands ui : customized ui from huawei , feels really good , but with such amazing ram , you can have any launcher you want camera : the front cam is good for selfies , back cam isn &apos;t the best in class compared .
the performance and look is simply good .
but the battery would dried out without using the mobile .
charged the mobile at night and found that 50 % of battery already dried out in the morning .
u sell this item is best but back case or flip cover not available your site or market so pls arrange first these item and then sell this product
hey guys , received yesterday this phone at only rs .
4500 ( with discount rs .
500 ) .
the phone look is very attractive and stylish , camera performance well , display quality good , i watch 1080p video without lag , 1 gb ram is quite faster , playing s s euro soccer , subway surfers without lag .
at price 4500 , this the best mobile at this time in the market .
writing after 15 days of heavy usage : 1 . look- gorgeous , doesn &apos;t look cheap at all ( mine is white ) 2 . ui : flat ui with very less emphasis on animations and graphics but more on lag free performance .
3 . display : bright excellent ; hard to notice the pixels .
4 . camera : unable to complain at this price ; night pics are a fab with dual led flash ; selfie okay but not very wide angled lens .
5 . storage : 8 gb of which 5 . 71 gb user available at 1st boot ; more can be added upto 32gb ( using ) 6 . ram ; 1 gb out .
beware buyers before going to this product .
instead spend some rs .
500 more to get quality and good phone .
pros : - nice build quality in this budget- ui is good cons : - worst touch .
it lags much- battery very poor .
you will regret if you purchase this product- camera not looks like 8 m p in fact 5 m p- worst performance .
giving 2 stars for build quality and ui .
flipkart please stop those chinese products .
y o u a r e l o o s i n g o n e v a l u a b l e c u s t o m e r
excellent product at this mouth watering price point .
: ) but flipkart u have to improve ur service .
it takes 6 days to reach the honor bee .
but packaging is good : ) honor bee .
a real honor screen : touch response is very good in this price .
better than my current samsung galaxy s duos 3 . ram : 1 gb in 4000 dont execpt anything .
storage : 8 gb inbuilt .
more than enough .
camera : average but not that bad either .
dont expect a dslr like quality from a 4000 rs fone .
battery : qui .
we can &apos;t expect more in this price range .
it is cool if you are using just for calls and less internet usage .
if it is second phone in your hand then go for it .
if you are going to use for full internet usage then don &apos;t buy it .
good entry level phone .
ui is pretty simple with no noticeable lag .
battery llfe seems to be reasonable with a day backup with moderate use .
what it lacks is the notification led .
sound is reasonably loud and camera quality is good in good to moderate lighting conditions .
overall a good entry level phone and for 4499 ( including 10 % credit / debit card offer ) its a steal .
dear review writers please write a genuine review .
i bought this mobile after reading reviews only cons : 1 . battery draining faster ( when i kept full charge in night it is showing 70 % of charge now with out any usage , without wifi .
2. display icons are pixalated .
( you can not find clear icons ) 3 . touch is slow4. unnecessary vibrations you cant keep it in normal mode when messages arrives it always vibrates .
5. call quality is louder that your frient can hear your conversation with out speaker6. he .
i got this phone for 4k .
i am writing this review after using it for 5 days .
overall performance is good .
but the touch response is not upto the mark .
camera quality is good .
battery it comes for around 24 hrs even if you use gps , wifi and data .
pros : decent battery life high quality camera good music output good performance good look slim cons : touch sensitivity is less it runs on kitkat version of android .
( lollipoop not yet released for this phone ) my final verdict is &quot; its worth for what .
average phone .
i got it in 6499 / -
it was difficult to choose this product as it was just launched .
smart look .
amazing phone .

build quality appears to be little unsatisfactory compared to honor holly 2 . there are no heating issues .
have not tried any games and cant comment on dat .
very slim n sleek to hold .
but may slip from hand .
battery appears to be give good backup , 3000 m ah however lacks turbo charging .
this phone is good for normal day to day use n browsing .
no heating camera .
good performance .
good sound .

fallen in love with vivo .
awesome phone with great display and great camera .performance is very good .
display is very vibrant .
camera quality is awesome .
battery life is also ok but not upto mark .
overall experience is very good .
received item in very good condition , very fast delivery by flipkart .
review after using vivo v15 pro for 6months i found it is excellent phone .
i never had any issues .
overall experience was very good .
i have took some snaps at my home and camera clarity is very good .
performance , camera and display rocking .
but the battery charging has some bug .
vivo says it has dual engine charging .
for 90 % of charge its good but after that 90-100 % it takes nearly 40mins .
please vivo fix this .
for the price this is very disapointing .
except charging time others are too good .
especially the camera and display and finger print .
great phone with great display , in fingerprint sensor works great and face unlock is some what different experience .
build quality is also ok. till now phone is looking great will share pros and cons on full review .
this phone is amazing first impression popup camera ,
excellent super amoled display ,
superb fast in display fingerprint 5th generation ,
face unlock with in half second ,
back camera performance superb ,
night mode photos osm ,
pubg smooth gaming play no lags ,
this phone performance over all pretty cool and excellent super osm awesome
but price little high
first of all , a big thanks to flipkar for delivering the product on day of release .
this is my first phone from vivo .
no doubt it is really an awesome phone.killer look.from every angle it looks so stunning .
color of mobile is osom !
reviews based on 1 week of usage :
screen is bigger and feather touch feel and works smooth .
performance of funtouch os very fast .
camera -clarity is superb , popup mechanism is an innovative and works well .
decent fast charging , futuristic pop up selfie camera has mismerised me .
it &apos;s better than redmi note7 pro in most respects .
overall i love this phone although it &apos;s little bit over priced .
the pop up camera is quite stunning and brilliant .
when i take selfie in public , people don &apos;t help but stare me and my phone .
that &apos;s the real charm .
it catches attention of people .
i have been using this device for the last 4 days .
here are my observations -
1 ) build of the phone .
people say its made of plastic , but who cares , you anyways would use it with a case .
even without case , i don &apos;t think its too bad as some say .
my preference is ruby red !
2 ) i have been a samsung user for the last 6 years .
the ui in this phone is a great upgrade for me and i am liking it more than touchwiz ( samsung ui ) .
3 ) camera is very good .
the selfie camera is pretty cool .
brilliant work done by vivo .
now that &apos;s the smartphone which contains loads of features in this price tag .
although i &apos;ve prebooked this phone so i got healthy discount on it .
must recommend to go for this vivo smartphone .
good battery back up and fast charing is good
very good and i love this phone .
great performance and great work .
love thie camera and also beautiful features .
quietly disappointed for case cover because its little bit rough .
otherwise over all superb .
what an awesome mobile .
thank you flipcraft for an extra discount on no cost emi .
awesome camera and all features .
just a must buy mobile
v15 pro is an amazing and attractive phone .
camera and its photo quality is adorably awesome .
amazing product with fast service from flipkart .
camera has too many options to go with and basically we can say that we have professional camera in our hand to be honest .
display is made of amoled and thats clearly visible .
it was great unbeatable product , and great experience too , battery back up was great and fast charging was unavailable.camera department was excellent there is no any other mobile to bit vivo v15 pro , simply great device .
i have used number of cell phones right from nokia6600 , n8 , samsung galaxy and many more and latest one was redmi note 5 pro .
the best feature in vivo v15 pro is its camera and also 6 gb ram makes its performance super .
i am using from past 1 months over all cell phone is ok and i dont like 2 things in this cell phone is
1. not given c type charger
2. night cam is not clear and 48 mp sensor is there but the actually 12 mp cam and they are fooling us guys .
all are good .
but problem is popup camera sound .
it make irritated all the time especially at night ( sleeping time ) .
and it is not a worth of 29k .
best price for this mobile is 23 -24k .
but im little worried with back side of the phone is polycarbonate .
camera is good , ill give 4 number for back camera .
front ill give 5 out 5. i like fast charging.backup is good .
3triple camera is awesome .
i just loved back cover come along with phone .
no doubt it is really an awesome phone .
from every angle it looks so stunning .
delivered by flipkart on the next day of launch .
exposure may be adjusted for bokeh effect .
adjustments also can be done for portrait selfie studio light .
night mode works so brilliantly .
but 48 mp sensor is just a gimmick , photos are very soft if 48 mp photos are taken , otherwise no complaint with the camera .
wide also takes a great shot .
pop up selfie is the .
vivo v 15pro good one camera is performed so well look wise also nice overall phone is good and camera is also perform very well
phone is ok but i don &apos;t say the best in this price range .
if you are looking for a good looking phone with a decent battery backup and a decent camera , go for it .
but if you want to have a phone with better performance , better camera and you are a gamer too , go for one plus which price is dropped now for 8gb , 128gb version .
in display fingerprint sensor of this phone is not fast .
the most important thing is , juat because of a new function of popup camera do not get attracted with vivo and opp .
super phone and fast charge and battrry back up is super and camera also is super .
totaly the is best and super phone
most beautiful and lovely phone in my life .
its a awsome gift for me .
thank you mom for thik gift ️
full screen experience is very emersive .
cameras are really good .
finish is very premium .
the pop up mechanism is an eye candy for everyone .
the price is a bit more if we compare it with phones having similar hardware but this phone is one of its kind .
so happy to pay a bit extra for the notch less experience .
one of the best thing abt this phone is the pop up camera &apos;s speed .
the moment u click on the camera icon , the camera pops out and also closes fast .
but plz be careful while handing these delicate items to ur kids .
or else it will be popped out for ever .
firstly , its a really good phone providing latest technologies like bezel free display , pop up camera , in screen finger sensor , so phone experience is great .
display is good , camera is good , specially the dedicated night mode which brightens image , processing is fast , pop up cam is super fast .
but if i have to nitpick , then here are some drawbacks .
overall , phone is quite bulky and heavy , camera hump is also large , single handed operation is impossible .
though camera is great , but there is no .
fantabulous phone wid superb build quality , outstanding camera nd excellent performance widout any lag .
the best model into this price segment .
go for it without any doubt .
you will definitely gonna love it .
it is fabulous phone i have ever used .
good battery life , well equipped camera , seamless performance and best display .
best part is the display and ca .
love the phone .
got a latest update which change everything like adding dark mode and new ui and stability .
best in it &apos;s price .
but the flipkart change option is worst .
the exchange guy will try to find a small issue for u to reject it .
it seems like a they r fooling people around and service is worst of all .
my final purchase not from flipkart i mean ( wall mart )
rear camera low performs super.selfie camera is good expect .
battery back up good .
worth mobile thank you flipkart
phone looks is so ausm .
front camera is good but rear camera in night mode is not good as compair to oppo f11pro .
m attached photo of night mode just you see the clarity of that photo , that photo of day not in night however photo quality is not good .
face lock is not working fast .
it takes 2 or 3 attempt to detect face .
i also using vivo v11 pro it &apos;s face lock is so fast , it &apos;s detect in dark room also .
m very happy with v11pro but with v15 not .
so bad face lock yar .
i am not satis .
nice phone with elegant feature-
nice rear and pop-up front camera
3. high storage as internal
4. duel engine fast charging
6. nice protective guard and cover
7. high performing processor
8. efficient battery backup
i am really satisfied with this featute in this range .
highly recommended go for it .
this is excellent mobile phone , beautiful gift for my daughter , lovely colour , awesome performance , thank to flipkart , and delivery was within time
nice super camera , full h d display and working smoothly worth of money .
superb display , best camera , excellent camera quality , great audio quality .
excellent performance without any lag.the only minus is usb port instead of type c .
the front camera is good but overall not a great product .
have been using for 4 months now , i think one plus would have been a better choice
i am using this device for last 2 n half months and i am giving 4 star overall .
d main problem is in the portrait mode of d camera .
it does not work every time and no update has yet been come .
others things are good not best if i consider this phone with its price rs.27000 / - .
in display fingerprint sometimes not working properly .
highly satisfied after 3 months of use .
675 processor is good but at this price segment they should have gone for high end processors like 855 , but does work decent even for heavy users .
# error !
good product and this mobile is awesome like camera sound and super amulet display .
and look so attractive
its a very good phone , comes under very good budget as compare to other vendors in terms of both features and quality under 30000 rs .
features are like of 50000 rs phone .
satisfied with performance so far
the phone display , touch , and camera are great .
the pop up camera is very good for selfies and there are many editing options in beauty mode .
the one screen fingerprint sensor is super fast .
6.39 inch screen sounds big , but because the screen is edge to edge and hardly any bezel , the phone is comfortable to hold and use easily .
the screen touch is also very fast and smooth .
the rear camera is also very good and captures good photos even in low light .
the wide angle photos with the wide ang .
both front and back .
8mp ultrawide angle camera is not so useful .
except when u have to take a pic of a large group .
but the image wkll not be as clear as in the normal mode .
boquet effect is awesome .
front camera can take pics with sufficient detail even in low light .
battery will last 24hrs will moderate to heavy use .
it takes 1hr for it to go from 0 to 70 % .
another 30min to reach 95 %
display quality is excellent .
eye protection mode is helpful if u r reading news n .
the battery is very poor .
without extensive use it drains quickly .
camera - is just ok. expected a lot but its ok. not bad .
i expected selfie camera to be better but with 32 mp not that great pic .
rear camera - so confusing to get the exact mega pixel , i still wonder whats the spec of rear camera , 12 mp , 16 or 48 , but pic quality is fine .
definitely not value for money .
oppo f11 is better in cheaper price range .
vivo v15 pro is great in terms of looks and both camera .
processor 3.5 / 5 as gaming experience could be made better and processing slows down in album when lot of videos and photos are there .
music on earphones 3 / 5 as it lacks bass and loudness on vivo earphones as well as sony and jbl headphones so its the chip issue .
value for money 3 / 5. for camera and display its the best
this phone is awesome
but its been a problem to stay connected with my samsung gear s2 smart watch
but other than that its a very very good phone just go for it
design pop up camera = 10
iam very pleased with this phone except the connection with my smart watch
vivo v15 pro is best and performance is good smooth and camera is much good but price is high as compare all smartphones have same features with low price.but overall i like this smartphone .
good phone with a neat camera specs !
pop up and fingerprint sensors great !
not so bad battery and a good fast charge !
it takes less time from 0-90 but take alot more within last 10 percent .
overall a good buy but i still miss my honor 10 .
very nice phone cool display and cool performance front camera is very good
awesome mobile , camera is very fantastic , performance is very good over all very good mobile phone i love it .
this product is not worth money and having many deficiencies as per my experience .
battery is draining very fast .
not very user friendly
it takes 120 min to fully charge , so telling it fast charging is not very wishful
camera of the mobile is very good
it &apos;s better to buy a good camera in this range rather buying mobile for camera
6.music and sound is loud and good .
7.its kind of mix reaction from my end but ultimately not worth money since price is 29000 but i got this phone at .
mobile is very nice i am very happy thank you for flipkart camera is amazing please please very nice and mobile very good very nice price i am very happy thank you
i am using this phone for a week now .
and would rate for camera and display .
nice performance and fast processor .
for battery i will give 2 star .
phone is getting hot while charging and playing videos and games .
very fast processor , no lags in playing high quality games .
low light photography is far better when compared to v11 .
overall satisfied with the phone performance .
whether its worth sharing or not , updating from older phone via easy share saved lot of time and energy and all the apps along with pics and document is replicated in my new phone .
after a year use , still going on like beast .
better than most of recent phones .
i was looking for a phone to replace my assus zenfone 5z which was working fine , but i got bored with it .
the vivo v15 ui is normal nothing fancy and the screen also is normal .
finger print sensor on the screen is laggy and 50 % time only it working .
however the good part is the camera .
resolution is good and bookeh is also good .
wide angle lens is not that useful as i feel like its modifying the picture in stretchy way .
i feel like its kind of expanding the picture so its not a true wide angl .
on performance wise it is nice set but on design wise it is fail no style no feel like it is new .
overall it is just good phone
awesome experience till now 6 month ago i have purchased .
form this to now mobile camera , battery life , and performance are up to mark level .
great value for money .
display softness is great with finger .
its my great experience i happy with this phone its camera quality super thanks flipkart for fast delivery according to me overall good experience
camera quality super se bhi uper vivo v15pro wow amazing smartphone thank you flipkart
vivo v15 pro is very good smartphone nice to good product .
i love display .
pop-up cameras are an interesting concept , but only a few ( quite expensive , to be honest ) handsets use this design approach right now .
fortunately , the popular chinese brand vivo is ready to bring this gimmick to the mid-range sector of the market with the help of the upcoming v15 pro handset .
after quite a few leaks and rumors , this handset has been spotted at geekbench .
the listing that belongs to the vivo 1818 device also mentions a snapdragon 6150 soc , but a recent certification confirme .
excellent mobile for selfy lover , smooth touch good performance , upto 80 % battery charging is good then ok .
one of the best phone in the market .
camera quality is too good &amp; amp ; ecery pixel is clear .
low light quality is auto adjustable .
storage capacity is sufficient in 128 gb .
battery life is sufficient .
charging is too fast .
in tem of looks , phone is great &amp; amp ; handy .
all over best in the market within 30k range .
very nice phone value for money battery backup was nice and super dual boost charging
it is smooth n good for gaming n it has fast engine charging and the night mode is awesome
one of the best phone by vivo great camera great battery overall 5 star .
super happy nice and gentle service thank u flipkart it is the best of all shopping sites
best in class and range .
its very nice phone as compare to all redmi phones , battery backup is very nice and support all 4k videos i like this phone at this price
display damaged after 7 months of usage .
selfie is good but back camera not good aspect price range .
i m not satisfy with camera others r good .
good product camera clarity is super and the flipkart service is superb
brilliant cameras , both front and back .
low light camera quality is quite brilliant as well .
stunning display and great performance .
the only drawback is that the phone heats up a bit after a continuous usage of even 30-45 min .
its is not scorching hot , but hot enough .
fingerprint sensor is a little slow as compared to my honor view 10 , but in display sensor looks quite fabulous .
sound quality is quite good , with and without headphones .
overall a very very good product to buy .
amazing camera , amazing display , very smooth and battery also very good , one day continously used , great phone , but late delivery for me ok
very good product and camera is also very nice .
features are also nice but phone is too costly .
super moblie and battery saver good oppstion and display bright ness awesome and good settion
all function of mobile like camera , working speed arrr fabulous love this phone .
great quality nd great perpormence .
battery is good if vivo gives 4500mah battery no doubt phone is clearly winner .
but over all good phone
i m not happy with the camera quality of this phone .
camera quality is average .
in terms of battery backup , it is pretty decent .
it doesn &apos;t have a glass back but the plastic body is quite satisfying .
it has a amoled display , which is very gud .
performance of this phone is good .
sometime it behaves strange like closing apps playing audio songs .
in terms of safety , in-screen fingerprint is available but sometime it read my friend &apos;s fingerprint as my , this is a serious issue this device .
best mobile with best gaming experience and with best camera .
best phone my life my phone pubg best garphics goos and best camera and best baittry and best photoshot phone
camera takes good pictures , but videos are bad .
battery is good for 1day of heavy usage , fast charging is effective .
performance is not of a 25k phone .
screen should have been corning glass , finger prints are visible on the screen .
big plus of this phone is the weight , feels lighter in hand compared to k20 pro or one + 7 pro .
i cancelled k20 to buy this for good camera it offers and super amoled display .
all overall is good but display is not good bad video quality .
go for other company as like samsung for better to vivo
i am used samsung a6 + overall good to vivo
i hated it display
super mobile friends im using 4 months really very good mobile thank you soooomuch vivo and flipkart very fast delivery
over all good deal on this range of phones .
good battery and super display and camera is too good
awesome ph and camera excellent superb i love it
sometimes we eagerly await for the excitement .
and the phone really delivered .
the product was awesome .
the plus point is the camera .
i have a oneplus 6t and this vivo surpass it in quality .
love the phone and loved the time delivered to me .
was the fastest i have ever got from flipkart .
awesome phone , good cleartly , very easy to operate , m very happy with this product which i have order from fhlipkart
purchased this product for gifting purpose .
look and feel : extremely happy with the hardware , design , look and feel .
camera : camera quality is at par .
you can &apos;t expect much from its camera if you are using / have used samsung high-end phones .
pop-up selfie camera : the pop-up selfie camera , especially its robotic sound is awesome .
sim and storage : option to use 2 sims ( both 4 g active ) alongwith memory card is great to have feature .
needless to mention that this phone anyways .
you can spend another 5k and purchase one plus 7
it has very good speed , camera and better build quality then v15pro .
not worth buying this phone for this price range 27 / 29k
it &apos;s a fantastic mobile .
and camera quality is a top class .
touch is simply amazing .
really go for this product if you are planning to buy one .
plus i am really happy with the way flipkart conducted the delivery of this product .
also the exchange process is also very simple and easy .
display is awesome , cameras quality is exceptionally very good .
battery back is good .
ultimately all things are good whatever you are looking in a complete mobile
while charging phone heats up .
camera , performance and .
style is awesome .
blue color is perfect .
i &apos;m not happy for battery
good product.back camera not that great bt front camera awesome and wide engle camera also useful bt charging is not that great
a very good phone with an excellent camera .
the pop-up showoff also works ; - ) no problems with the pop-up camera so far .
the wide angle lens is also a very good feature included .
in short , a must buy .
i always cherish one thing in vivo , you are the one to unveil new &amp; amp ; different technologies and the price you setup is spellbound .
loved it from every single view point
nice product by vivo .
finally i feel it provide something better then samsung .
like camera and performance .
but after using i feel camera is good but not the best .
very beautiful working phone very very good phone resolution js to good camera goes in if the phone drops down love the camera pubg work in high graphic in hd luv this phone
but the price is somehow high
great purchased from flipkart
and performance of vivo v 15 pro also good
i recommend to all premium mobile lovers to go for it
who gives 1-3star review mark they are baised or they have no knowledge about smart phone .
i want to give 4.5 star marks to vivo v15 pro .
cause i am a real user .
i purchase atleast 3-4 mobile in a year since 2009. as per my experience there is some sily lag of composition on vivo v15 pro handset .
no c type port .
battery life needs ab .
camera is top class , design is excellent , everything is great except for the charging which takes more than expected .
got it the next day i ordered
128gb storage plus dedicated memory slot
i love after sale vivo support
4000mah of battery &amp; amp ; snapdragon 845 could have been given instead of 3700 &amp; amp ; snapdragon 675
everytime i say my friend , oppo is better than vivo all time .
this phone is good enough at the price point .
but i recommend you go for oppo .
best phone on best price !
i got good discount on exchange .
seamless front camera , good quality pictures .
most amazing is it &apos;s performance as i use multiple apps at a time with high speed and battery supports that too .
toggling between apps are also easy so i am highly satisfied
nice front and back cameras and great vivid screen .
performance is good and have seen no heating issues .
battery life is also good .
battery easily lasts for one full day .
the best part is lightning fast finger print scanner and the pop up selfie cam .
really happy with the phone and have not seen any major flow as such .
go ahead without any doubt .
unbelivable performance in low light photography .
charge very fast , nearly takes 1hr for full charge .
stylish look but less concentration give in protection of display and back ( as it made up of plastic ) .
super display , super camera , fast processor , only one thing it is little bit costly .
if it was 24k it would be perfect .
after 2 days of usage i am writing this review .
camera quality is superb .
popup selfi camera is mind blowing with good picture quality .
build quality is so premium .
just little bit expensive .
overall a good buy
amazing phone super fast delivery i am very very happy .
it is a very good and quality phone for me like it .
it reach to in very good condition and also in good package .
i like the flifkart service .
better experience for super amoled display
first impression in display 5th gen fingerprint scanner .
excellent camera quality with triple camera .
battery backup is good and fast charging .
amazing phone in this price range .
mobile sound is not something special .
too good , nice camera quality and beautify option within the camera .
excellent design , super slim .
nice display , no need of tempered glass .
i love pop up selfie camera .
phone is excellent very very happy to buy this phone and seriously guys very fantastic phone and phone displays very good giving more it &apos;s awesome
* this smartphone is nice in cameras .
* not so much good battery life .
* good for normal users .
* not a reliable price .
pop-up is a delight and the beauty mode in whatsapp calls and msg calls is a top-up .
battery life is adequate for a day &apos;s usage .
triple slot is very useful .
special button is handy .
but as compare to samsung a9 .
its little bit not better than that .
which is not given in this .
whenever the price is same .
i dont think its work as like a 6gb ram speed
the phone overall is good like any other vivo phone
but only thing i don &apos;t like is the weight of the phone
very nice phone fantastic fabulous wonderful just i &apos;m love of this phone impressive nice packing thanks flipkart
looks its great fone
camera is good but low light situation its just average
battery if u use it just as mobile phone for calls , camer , music and movie its ok but if u use for gaming ( pubg ) its draining very fast
there is a heating problem while playing pubg not very hot but is heating .
over screen finger print lock is not upto mark not satisfied had to keep my thumb 2 to 3 times and had press on the scree almost every time whenever i wanted to unlock my phone : (
it is charging fast .
im not vivo lover but after this mobile definitely i tell one thing just go for buy it superb mobile great screen , great camera , great performance best on the market right now in this price
value for money .
one of the best smart phones in this price .
processor may be given a little bit better like sd 845. i gifted to my wife and she really happy with overall performance of the phone .
dnt think just go for it .
all of this i said after 10 day &apos;s use .
but only regret is it &apos;s high price .
this phone should have been more desirable and sought after for people with less price tag like mi &apos;s some models .
its a pretty good phone to use .
a bit delicate but still good .
very premium in design and material .
flipkart delivery was spot on
very good smartphone , best of the best .
although i got many problems during the delivery but the device is really fabulous .
i would recommend it to everyone .
bezel and notch free display , amoled hd , and the pop up camera is just breathtaking .
i love the special features for gaming .
with the most amazing features .
sound quality was amazing
it &apos;s very nice phone nd i got a very good exchange deal with my old phone mi redmi note 3 from flipkart .
i am very happy thank u so much flipkart .
camera is the main reason i bought this phone .
features are too good for the price range .
would &apos;ve been awesome if it came with sd835 or something .
i was eagerly waiting for my order , after several followups finally received after some delay .
now coming on to the phone , it is a delight to have this phone in this price .
configuration wise it is an excellent choice .
i am very happy to have this phone .
frigerprint was working so fast .
and i think this is best mobile phone in 2019
i have been using it for more than a week .
the obvious highlight is the super amoled full screen display .
being an amoled it also offers a always on display which can show date and time .
i liked the ruby red color more though both colors look elegant .
the built quality is very good and the phone is thin but a little on the heavier side .
the back is glossy polycarbonate so it would probably survive a few falls .
both back and front cameras perform very well .
the pop up mechanism works .
superb camera especially selfie .
bty life is superb .
charging full in one hr and ten mins .
lots of other effects also .
back cover with plastic body disappointed me .
when you add 3 or more finger prints , the scanning speed gets little slow .
however overall a smart phone .
review after 3 months .
camera is superb and awes .
great design , superb built quality for the price .
2 ) nice to hold - overall aesthetic are great
3 ) super fast processing power
4 ) custom os looks great so far
few things have small issues .
1 ) display attracts dust too much .
2 ) phone case supplied is simply ugly .
tried to use but removed immidiately .
3 ) display glass does not have any protection like gorilla glass 5 etc .
4 ) today when i check specs i realize that i never got headset .
headphone missing in the box .
snapdragon 675 is a bit disappointing at this price
no fast charging it is taking more than a hour even at 16k other mobiles providing type c
no ir for face unlock
overall worth buying if u r looking for a good cam and for look also for gaming
superb phone this price segment .
only one con this phone no usb type c .
camera very good .
indisply fingerprint is superb .
better than samsung s10 plus .
nice phone , better performance , excellent camera , i want give 5 star in flipkart to fast delivery
the phone is just awesome .
camera quality is improved from their past versions of vivo .
the most satisfying thing in the phone is its front pop up camera .
the price is bit high according to phn .
the features are awesome and i love this product .
nice phone , some features like i-phone , i like it love it
camera is just awesome .
picture quality sooo good .
battery capacity also very good .

best mobile amazing camera
the phone is good .
actually its quite impressive .
but the price of the phone must be around rs26000 not 29000
good phone with popup camera .
flipkart exchange policy was too bad .
u have to give brand new device as exchange they won &apos;t accept if ur phone have small dent on it .
you will be carefull if u planning to do exchange
super phone but price is little high
cam is just wow

i am writong the review after 3 months of use this product .
battery is just ok .
else all are good
but , the finger scaner working is very bad .
it recognize my finger after 3 time of try , every time
nice phone dont worry about the review which are negative you can spent money for this mobile
vivo v15 pro is a good phone .
but it is a bad experience to purchase it from flipkart .
bcoz on flipkart i purchase it for 28990 after two days i purchase it from market for 26500
vivo v15pro phone is good but phone case is not good
awesome but type c is missing they must offer type c port in this prince range
superb phone camera is awesome
very nice phone with pop up selfie

amazing camera , amazing look , amazing display , new technology
have all features in good rate .
super phone i love it
nice camera so impressive
another satisfied smart phone give me vivo .
flipkart making fool customer to exchange mobile.so don &apos;t buy any products from flipcart .
very very god product
awesome mobile and camera best .
nothing much difference as compare to v11pro but pop up front camera give additional advantages .
the vivo os is not so great ( can be changed )
4000mah of battery could have been given instead of 3700
nic mobile but price is too high .
but mobile performance is good
full review after one week use
camera is incredibly good
performance is also good
battery backup last upto complete day
sound and fingerprint unlock time fix after update
no manual mode in video camera setting
charge slow as compared to other device
c type port missing
bass is low when you listen music in earphone
flipkart is doing fraud with all peoples
i have enjoy with full view display screen .
i just luv dis its really nice it works like butter i just luved it
display is the most amazing part of this phone .
very nice phone best price thank you for filpkart
a very good device for daily use .
abit disappointed by the vivo funtouch os with less customization options all else 5 star
its a worst product from the flipcart side .
performance wise very bad .
in my opinion not to purchase this product from flipcart bcus my phone box didn &apos;t sealed properly and earphones was missing in the box .
and flipcart does not resolve my replace request .
nice product but costly .
excellent phone but it was talking too much time charge
fast charging , camera , backup , storage
just 1 word &quot; wow &quot; go for it without reading the negative review .
phone model - vivo v15pro
camera is good , battery is good as it is a new phone .
there is no lagging while doing anything with the phone but still it is new phone : p .
set is quite heavy and with the case it is giving a real heavy feel .
pop up selfie new technology is quite impressive with android pie .
48 mp is only a number .
amazing camera and display .
performance is to good .
but better is just ok .
vivo the best mobile
always be good phone
display quality is very good .
but flipkart exchange policy is very bad .
they expect a phone with not even a single dot .
if it priced around 24k then surely it will value for money
thnx flipkart for timely delivery
beautiful phone , front camera excellent .
has to be my best buy in the recent times .
the delivery was in time .
best product but little costly .
but classy mobile while pop up camera open .
i have brought by exchange my old mobile .
very much happy , no words to say .
very nice full happy
my first ever full screen mobile .
battery is good with 3700mah and display everything is very impressive .
every time with something new vivo make us feel wow !
this time also with vivo v15 pro set a benchmark by giving everything or beyond what we think in this mobile .
great product to buy i definitely recommend this as i am also user of oneplus i must say this time vivo is better than oneplus .
this phone screen round thats is why its bad mobile because temper glass protector not fix properly and display not fully hd very bad vivo dont bye worst product
i am using a tiktok app , onyl 5 to 10 mints , phone is very hit and back side , battery backup is not good performance , good and popop selfi camera .
best camera quality , beautiful design , advanced features
im very happy with this product after using about 4days coz it &apos;s overall performance is fully satisfactory .
and it &apos;s battery &amp; amp ; camera performance is 100 % satisfactory .
photos are awesome and it has futuristic technology camera pops up very fast.finger print is also very fast.it has various features so you are not required to install seperate apps for those features
ruby red colour not as shown in pic
thanks for flipkart for exchange my old mobile .
and also v15 pro mobile is awesome
i like it too much .
camera performance so good
i checked the night mode and works brilliantly well .
camera is awsome , battery is very poor
front camera is not at all good in low light .
battery drains very fast .
it even charge fast .
30 minutes 45 % .
need to mirror screen from google home for chromecast support .
only one words waaaaaow
night mode is better far more than your expectation .
wow awesome and thanks to vivo to make a perfect phone .
unlike vivophones , this one has awesome build quality .
power packed camera both front and rear .
premium feel once u hold it in hand .
pop up give u a top of the world experience .
a must but if u are ok with the budget .
best phone in the segment but with some cons also like it has micro usb port and polycarbonate body in this price otherwise best phone to buy in terms of camera preformance designs
all over phone vivo v15 pro is a best for everything specially for pop up camera and rear camera phone performance high class access every app
camera quality is so high regulation picture
good looking and very stylish
it has added too much colors to my life now .
it &apos;s been less than 2 weeks since i bought the phone .
honestly i started loving it .
i bought it mainly for the mobile photography purpose and i must say the camera is pretty amazing .
especially the wide angle lens .
the phone does have some flaws though .
the finger print scan doesnt work most of the time .
some apps gets stuck .
but most importantly the pop up selfie cam in my phone is faulty .
it stopped retracting showing a failure message .
i &apos;ll have to get it sorted from the service center an .
nothing as of now
must buy if you &apos;re having second thoughts .
very.good in all departments of function .
my only doubt was the software , but there seems to be nothing wrong with it also .
my priority was to buy a a phone with maximum features without spending too much and this solved that problem .
awesome phone ever keep it up vivo , awesome camera too happy
camera super display super awesome .
price should have been around 25k .
other things are up to mark .
amazing mobile to god cameras .
worth for money but disappointment with battery .
but fast charging it fulfill that .
i faced very worst experience with ekart delivery guy .
he is very rude .
he called several times to me but he never told i need to carry id card .
this phone camera is superb .
look and feel is amazing .
the coolest phone ever .
i just loved it very much ️ .
camera is excellent , battery charged very fast , various new modes in camera , looks smart .
camera is not upto mark .
i think the rear camera not even 24 mp.selfie camera also .
the pop up system response is fast .
but , i &apos;m totally disappointed with camera .
and only limited apps we can only used with split screen .
flash light is very low .
awesome camera and battery good performance and value for money good delivery experience in flipcart
back camera quality is very good .
best phone in this range
camera is to good
for charging type c cable is not given
i had pretty ordered vivo v15 pro on the launch date .
got it on march 5the , 2019. pros :
front and back cameras
funtouch os is not for my taste .
battery could have been bigger .
overall you can use this mobile for a full day with medium use with a bluetooth headset attached .
calls are loud and clear .
there are no noticeable lags .
btw , if you &apos;re interested , i got rid of the default launcher .
a wonderful mobile for .
must buy phon is fabulous
great n awesome phn.ty flipkart
best smart phone this year
beautiful phone awesome features
excellent design and value for money
not worth phone pls don &apos;t buy its not working properly waste of money i lost my 29000 / - for this mobile and flipagram says not returning phone
rear cam is average .
the build quality and the performance of this mobile is too good but the price of this mobile is little hai .
there are many software issues .
some of ui updated are not so handy .
otp and other password should in hidden while screen is locked .
if you try to read msg while using some other app then the read option under msg received is not working .
they gave faulty product for me , issue with popup camera .
u cant find the issue for the first time .
after running 3 , 4 days u will realize the pop up camera issue , irritating noise came during pop up .
i love this mobile , very good for all permance , i installed 74games but no slow , good speed
the unique design with unlimited features .
color and the slimmer shape with 32mp pop up selfie camera made the display undisturbed in the name of drop camera or cut display .
even if anybody trying hacked to access our selfie cam without our permission , we would be alerted by the pop camera for unnecessary cam launch from our phone .
fast charger great feature
only the missing feature is no usb type-c port .
all aspects are ok. only one con is that no shortcut ( mobile data , aeroplane mode , wifi , hotspot , etc ) are not present in notification bar
is earlier buyers are fools
think again and again
y u going to buy a unbranded on high price .
u must have a reason for it .
charging take more than 2 hours only use pop up camera
best ever phone in thz range
i got a heavy issue .
my screen got colour spred over it automatically .
time to time the colour is spreading on my screen .
it &apos;s totally waste of my money .
i know the care center will charge more money for display change .
it is my last and final purchase of vivo phone .
vivo v15 pro mobile always good in all category except battery
very poor quality camera .
48 mp is just a lie .
quality of pics is poorer than a 15k phone .
not happy with the phone at all .
camera is what i bought it for and it &apos;s the biggest disappointment .
screen is really good .
but overall a disappointing deal .
i expected a really good phone from the flagship phone
what a camera.amazing pictures.battery life also good for a day usage with all your works.performance is also good for normal gamers.value for money in its price range
battery back up is not upto the mark &amp; amp ; in music i miss the bass no effects of bass in the music .
if these two problems is solve then its a good gadget .
plz take care of these problems &amp; amp ; if the possibility is there for these problems for solution by system update kindly do fast .
best phone at best deal and fast delivery .
this phone is very nice look and parfamons is very beautiful
after a year of use , i realized that spending 27k for this phone was not worth .
after all its a chinese product and cant be trusted for quality .
it &apos;s my first mobile phone purchase from vivo .
i love this phone
cemara is not good when we are going to zoom the pic and blurre will come
camera is not good
front camera ( pop-up ) photo quality is very bad .
when we zoom image its pixel broken .
so i suggest vivo plz improve front camera photo quality via software updates .
everything is good but the battery is too too poor
value for money .
just a battery backup not helpful only 3759 mah
i am writing this review after usage of this mobile for 6 months
camera is really good
phone speed is awesome
sometimes pop up get stuck
cemera quality is very good nice phone and battery backup is also good
the performance of the phone is truly awesome .
loving every bot of it .
would stongly recommend others also for this particular product from the house of vivo .
an awesome camera phone

good phone , vivo v15 pro is best mobile .
the camera , gaming performances are good and value for money
my charging cable is not working not evn 6 months
mobile is good but battery backup is not good .
all things was good
in love with v15pro .
only drawback is it &apos;s back body which attracts lots of scratches
camera quality and sounds quality is good but if you see online video facing some problems accessories ( headphones ) quality is very poor .
your ear could be pain .
overall i am satisfied .
after using two months camera pop is getting jam slow movement some time its getting stock while pop ing up .
dnot use face unlock because this only its getting slow pop .
good camera in night mode and wide angle view is also good .
gaming experience is very nice .
night mode awesome no words to describe i love it .
display also fabulous.overall superb
phone very good display - camera- looks performance .
but no gorilla glass protection so be careful .
best camera oriented phone
vivo v15 pro is an excellent phone in this price segment .
i just found 1 drawback that it is quite heavier than other phones .
could be due to triple rear camera .
love this mobile .
i cant belive this vivo v 15 pro is so dam .
i like it everything this mobile
vivo v15 beautiful mobile and function is beautiful
very nice product good camera quality , good battery backup .
very nice mobile value for money

finger print scanner is definitely slower than other devices .
mobile display , camera and mobile speed is good .

in love with this mobile .
service was also awesome
nice phone &amp; amp ; good camera display aasam
the battery back up is poor
guys though this mobile comes with adreno 612 gpu , it failed miserably in asphalt 9 game .
the least possible setting of the game also gives lots of frame drop and it is very difficult to play game .
with such a price tag vivo has to come with better hardware .
the camera as well not as good as v11 pro , which was far better than this .
camera flickers a lot when focusing on any light .
vivo please fix this issue
face lock finger print does not work
phone is looking good .
i realy feel every think is good , sorry better , but the main thing its performance which is not really good .
it &apos;s shame for vivo because afte 6 gb ram phone is hang during the open lock screen and aaps .
mobile is awesome but flipkart is delayed my order and exchange offer is v.good camera is good display is awesome
i am loving it .
product is good n nice bt only thing is charging pin in mob is nt good .
itz makes us confuse n indication of use cable of charger to connect the mobile they have miss guided .
dont buy the phone .
camera clearty not good .
display clearty not good .
very very worst performance .
flipkart not solve my problem .
camera quality is not good but oppo f11 pro camera guality is good
your coriuar partners is poor quality .
don &apos;t buy this product .
everything is fine in this phone instead of vivo promoting pubg to play game but in just an small angry bird game , phone have heating problem .
battery have dual engine and fully charged in 35 min only .
camera is awasome rear n front .
excellent phone go for it must buy &amp; lt ; 3
here are some camera shots i have taken
very poor network signal , dam frustrated with this phone .
request you all not to buy tgis phone
no security updates nothing , vivo is just so poor .
till now it is having 5th march security update .
it won &apos;t deserve to be called as flagship phone .
such a poor vivo .
front camera very good
all attached photos from front camera
overall best mobile phone
nyc cell.battry camera overall perfect cell
average mobile not valuable money
this is the good phone .
no issue with face camera .
but not to capture actually 32 mp photo
loved the phone but its a bit expensive but overall a very good phone with nice cameras and the pop up camera is in another league .
best ever smart phone , even better than vivo nex .
nice mobile and thanks flipkart wonderful service
nice phone from vivo .
good mid ranger performs well in day usage with 3 hrs of pubg dropping from 100 to 60
lock button damage .
camera quality was not good as the specifications shows and it also hangs sometimes .
if you buy it once then there is no way to change .
hifi audio mode not available in this mobile .
fingerprint &amp; amp ; mobile ram speed is good
overall average mobile but pricing is too high
they didn &apos;t take my phone as exchange just because of a small dent that too on back side of screen
have nothing to say in positive
worst product i had ever seen
nice fast charging and super camera quality ossum phone
wow so nice phone .
worst phone in my life i &apos;ve took .
one star for non damaged delivery and camera .
1. phone back is very sensitive , small dust particle is you try to clean it will become a scratch .
2. they &apos;ve gave plastic case which is worst , that even get scratches simply .
3. battery fast charging , double fast dis charging
4. system apps so many which you will never use so many times , no option to uninstall or disable .
5. not worthy of 26k .
6. you may have to use either screen guard or back c .
within 3hrs of usage sold to my frnd .
good for nothing only camera is good leaving that all boring from my personal view dint liked at all .
best but redmi note 7 pro best .
excellent but rear front camera flash is not there and image becomes blur if it is zoomed through back camera .
very poor phone in this segment .
totally waste my money on pop camera .
1.internet connectivity is very bad .
4.can &apos;t play smooth pubg very frame drop and lagged .
highly don &apos;t recommend this phone save your money
awesome phone great experience
worst display worst battery performance get hanged while playing games
product received in a very good condition .
chinese product bad product
camera is awesome , design is premium bt battery can be a bit better i think otherwise it could be a flagship phone
very very delicate display .
it gone bad within three months , even there is no falls on floor .
my previous mobile of honor 8x is much much better .
this amoled display costs 6500 and there is no warranty for the display .
very bad service from vivo as well as from flipkart .
nice product , better than redmi note 8 pro
very poor picture quality and low battery backup
writing this review after more than a year , the performance is good , no problem uptill just battery performance got weak .
depends upon one &apos;s usage .
if game lover i don &apos;t think battery will suffice .
front camera perfomance is good makes a little noise while opening and closing .
but front camera quality 32 megapixel is best .
back camera is also good with ai beauty .
ram and storage is well .
processor is excellent never got hang even after opening many apps at a time for long time .
battery capacity less , draining out fast .
very nice and very smartphone
good as per budget
best phone in this range
overall a nice product .
sad that it is not giving android 10 update .
also the in display fingerprint is bit slang .
phone with defect , mobile vibration not working .
i think because of vivo is not maintaining its brand quality .
not recommend this mobile
awesome camera worth of money .
a very good handset
front camer not working after 6 month .
battery issue &amp; amp ; camera quality very poor
not bad but heavy
display is not good , battery drain fast , performance is good , sound quality of speaker in not so good

the camera on this phone is really good and if you want to play the game , really good but the processor is a bit low but the button is good .
a very good.wid good battery performance .
nice product and product quality .
it is best phone in vivo
very very bad mobile
the best thing in this phone is only camera .
but battery is poor .
in hard use it does not stay more than 16 hours .
you need to charge it twice or may be thrice in a single day if you play hardcore games like pubg , asphalt etc .
overall i will give 3 / 5. nice phone
product is good and temper glass not fit display pls manufacturing full edge fit tempered glass
this is awesome , i have purchased just 15 days ago so far i m satisfied with it .
very good and attractive mobile
the product is very good .
i am giving 3 star because of the delivery .
the delivery guy was rude .
he took 4 hrs to cover a distance which is hardly 15 min .
and he has no manners as he use to hung up my call while i am not finish talking .
great product , camera quality is good
bit expensive if compared to local shops .
prouduct exchange is worst experience .
for old s7 9100 was exchange value .
delivery boy rejected the old phone saying tiny colour is lost near charging jack .
even as per exchange programe a less exchange value 7500 was also not offered to me .
so i have to pay 9100 in cash , exchange not work at all for me .
flipkart please improve exchange experience for your customers .
vivo is the best
the phone is very good and its performance is awesome but protective case is very scratchy , so overall i get 5star ratting .
mobile phone is good but wish master &amp; amp ; flipkart customer service is verry bad performance do not support of customer
camera quality is awesome .
thanks flipkart delivering on time and safely
very good am in love with vivo v15 pro
bougt this ph in this big billion offer .
everything is ok except battery backup .
because of camera only i chosen this phone .
but if front camera being used charge getting reduced very faster .
not even stand for 2 hr .
when contacted customer care they informed this is nature of this product .
if anyone plan to buy popup camera pl check battery should be atleast 5000mah .
iif third party apps consuming more power .
its amazing superb thanks for flipkart
everything was good except the battery capacity .
wide option was really adorable .
little costly but amazing phone

excellent and quality phone .
front camera requires flash at night .
battery is not upto mark .
i would &apos;ve given more stars for this product had it not been for the mobile case that comes along with it .
its so hard and bad edged finishing that putting the case on the phone gives a few scratches on the body .
then flipkart doesn &apos;t take exchange of the phone because of such extremely minor scratches and the 499 i spend on buyback guarantee goes to a waste .
earphone stopped working after 2 days
fast delivery thanks flipkart

battery consumed very fast and charged too slow .
1 % per 1 min .
thats too slow because its a fast charging phone .
the company said 50 % in just 15 to 20 min .
but its not done in my phone .
first 50 to 55 % 1 % per 1 min .
and other remaining 1 % per 2 min .
i already complaints registered on flipkart so many times but no one considering this matter seriously .
so please don &apos;t shop online .
this my request to all .

hi folks , this is one of the great phone .
if u are planning to buy with an exchange make sure the exchnagin phone is sort of new look .
else flikpkart guys reject it .
in that case go ahead with amazon .
this phone is excellent when it comes to camera and screen size wise.as it is 6gb obviously fast compared to 4gb ram .
undoubtedly go ahead and but maintain the front camera very careful

waste cam in mobile most worst mobile don &apos;t buying this mobile
only one is flipkart fabulous flipkart
not worth amount on which it is available , battery very poor but charging is very quick
price should hv been around 22 k max and battery should be improved
nice product but price is too high .
camera quality is very good.performance is good
but glass protector is not provided .
speaker not work well .
i m totally unhappy with this
eventhogh it has ai portrait , it is not blurr the background images .
ii am using airtel volte , the network speed is too slow .
other things are good
just buy it only for camera , screen and sound .
else , hard to operate .
very bad phone camera quality is very poor battery backup is very low
best product , worth of cost .
fantastic mobile in this range
awesome product in that &apos;s price
great if can spend 28k rupees
great phone and great job fk too
i am using this phone from last one week .
camera and performence of phone is great .
lookwise its give a feel of premium product .
best part is flipkart delivery .
got this phone on very next day .
5 star from my side .
usb c type charger missing , else all good .
if you want to play heavy games like punch .
dont buy this phone .
lots of lags are there .
some issue with fingerprint sensor &amp; amp ; when icons drag to the next page it has bit difficult to drag
perfect mobile at good price .
a very good phone .
however for novices like me the e- manual gives very little information , particularly the camera capabilities .
wish a detailed manual is available .
the second problem is non provision of c-type connection .
also while talking suddenly the screen becomes blank which disturbs the talk , not knowing where the stop button is .
a blinking light would have been a great help , particularly in the nights .
very very awsm yar

nice phone but price is very high

great design with best features
i am using i phone but this phone is super perfect .
this is the second of murakami books i laid my hands on .
i really loved the plot .
naturally , some surreal events are bound to happen in a murakami novel .
this novel is shorter than others and once you start it , you wouldn &apos;t feel like putting it down .
you can literally finish this in couple of hours .
just as i was expecting , the ending has been left open to interpret .
go for it .
je suis murakami .
got this book within three days of ordering ... and i have to say this is one of my favorite from murakami .
amazing book a must read !
somewhere between hogwarts and harry potter , we all grew up .
it is indeed one of the best books that i &apos;ve read .
good book .
i am not a reading fan , but this was very fun to read .
the first chapter is a bit boring but the from the second chapter the story really catches up .
book have just arrived one day before the expecting day .
the packaging was very good and secured .
i &apos;ve got the book in its best condition .
also got two cute bookmarks .
flipkart have always been my best place to shop books .
till now , they never disappointed me in any situation .
beautiful

i ordered this book 3 days back and received it in a terrible state the book doesn &apos;t look original and seems like a copy the book cover colour is just so diffrent from the original one moreover something i &apos;d written over the last page of book delibrately
very good quality on this price ..
paper quality is bad .
i &apos;ve watched harry potter movies many times ... but reading book is very much exciting than watching it ..
i think b &apos;coz it gives u every detail about it .... after my book is completed i am keenly waiting to order the next chapters ! !
excellent book .
no one can leave this while reading .
great epic adventure .
the readers must try other parts also .
i have ever reader in my life must buy and very fast delivery by flipkart

it was amazing to shop from flipkart .delivery was before time
good quality paperback .
book has just arrived 4days before the expecting day.awesome condition.happy to buy .
delivered book was not in well condition
excellent product please buy it.no mistake was there.delivery come before time. you are reading harry potter books you don &apos;t stop it .thankyou flipkart
all the pages are shuffled most pages are missing in the book .
very bad
it was not at all good which i have expected
worst paper quality .. huh ..
flipkart is best there &apos;s no comparison . i was at school when the my book was delivered i came home and was surprised to see my book . it was delivered two days earlier .
this book is among the best book u can ever read . this book won &apos;t let you put it down until it &apos;s completed . i was not a literature lover but after this book i am in love with literature . thanks to flipkart .now i am going to purchase whole series .
loved it .
the book is nice but they have not give book mark
poor pages .... not good ......
this is an excellent book and i wasn &apos;t able to wait to get my hands over it. this book is fabulous and since i got it for a very less amount i am so happy .
the book is the best book ever read .
love it when my friends talked about harry potter i was unawared about him but after reading this book i got to know about harry potter .
i will definitely buy the second part of harry potter .
but the only problem was that the cover page was some what torn and some pages were having marks of dirt on them .
so flipkart improve it .
overall the book was superb and above expectation .
the book is for all ages .
i am also a 13 years boy .
not satisfied with bo ...
received the book today ...
if you &apos;re a fan of harry potter books then this is a must buy .
for long run hardcover is always advisable .
anyone might think a lot about the money that they will be spending .
even i thought a lot in the beginning after seeing the heavy price , but when i received the book i felt the money was worth it .
got it for 830 inr .
the packing was great and there was no damage to the book . although it took more than 2 weeks to get delivered but that &apos;s fine .
my recommend ...
very bad quality binding came out and the colour was fadedreally not worth it !
nice but i didn &apos;t get bookmark
the book was neatly packed .
it arrived on the exact date of delivery .
the book is new and handsome without any defects .
there was also a flipkart bookmark in the box .
best service compared to amazon .
fabulous
the book is in good condition and the delivery is faster than i expected .
thank you flipkart .
v.good printing and realy fast delivery
good quality of book with a cute bookmark.its story is finominal i can &apos;t describe it in words .

all the mystery begins in this book and isn &apos;t resolved until the last part.what a sync. it only makes you think why it isn &apos;t real.i worship j.k. rowling .
loved this book , it is so interesting that once u start reading it , it will stick with your hands u just cant leave it
well this book is awesome no question about that .
and what makes this book more interesting that the offer we get from flipkart and one major plus point of flipkart is that they deliver before the due delivery date .. for that kudos to flipkart .

they were really fast and the best part is the book is brand new .
i was worried if it would be a new or used or damaged as some reviewer says so .
but thank god it was all well .

very bad quality of book ceap one and black spots on book and print is not good

very interesting and best book in the world love it
one of the best scripts out there ...... people might find it uninteresting as the characters have changed , and they might find it difficult to read the story as a script .
the nicest thing for the wizardry loving muggles , anyways.appreciable service by truecomretail via flipkart
the book is amazing ! ! !
to a potterhead it &apos;s everything best book ever i breadafter volfomort died i didn &apos;t thought a story will exist but believe me the story after that is much more fantastic

the book that i got was totally in good condition , well packed , and with a good quality paperback
loved the quality of the book ...
the pages are good and the story is written in script which implants the proper scene in our imagination and is very easy to understand ...
the story was awesome .
only true harry potter fans can understand
superb piece .
terrific delivery speed .
fully satisfied .
harry potter fans got to read it .
thank uh flipkart ..
only potter fans can know it &apos;s worth ... get the book in its best condition .. seriously asm ... go for it .. also the package was very clean and without any scratches ... get it before 6 days ... 5out 5 ..
no doubt about the book it was really good but the quality of book was not upto the mark
i liked this ....
very nice book
book is soo good ... , the whole story is on time travel ... mission of albus and scorpicus to save cedric who was affected in the goblet of fire ... finally a happy ending with no cedric .. so many twists ... i wish it would have come to films ... anyways jk rollings stories are always awesome .. , may people like the harry potter series ..
but i can &apos;t say it is better than the previous one i.e deathly hallows part 2 ... it is amazing .. u must read in order to know the ending ...
poor newspaper printing
day by day the quality of products that are sold in flipkart is degrading.i bought this book for rs 292 .
however the book is second hand with pages 35 to 50 missing .
apart from that some pages are repeated .
i have to think twice now before buying anything from flipkart .
great book .
great paperback
very nice and clean product.thank you flipkart .......
good story line nd awesome characters including ...... thanks jk rowling ...
satisfied with this product ... again flipkart did it &apos;s job greatly !

after the last part of harry potter , i was very excited to see the rest and when my patience broke up i ordered the book .and in a day after i read up 100 pages its is really a crazy book man . the book feels very light weight and the quality is as expected .
the page quality was awesome prices are reasonable
u knt stop reading the book once u start ..
bad book waste of money pathetic i don t &apos; like this book i was speaking good english but when i read this i lost all of practice of because of this book badest product i ever get from flipkart don t &apos; buy it is waste of money worst product
osam
nicely packed , clean book , superb printing , in last harry potter series all family trees and play casting , but one thing to confirm before buying this-you are a potterhead
it &apos;s awesome
totally original one
nice delivery and got the book in awesome condition
the book was perfectly alright and in very good condition . all pages were proper and well manged what an potter fan need more than this.overall happy with experience .
amazing
awesome .... just for harry potter fans ...
nice book
paper quality and binding of book is very poor .
it looks like it will tear apart while reading first time only .
will advise not to purchase from this seller .
very bad printing .
not expected from flipcart .
good
its good but is very small and the printing is also not very good.it can be read a book once but not recommended to gift it .
as expected
it &apos;s very good book ..
good story less than expectations
coll
no bookmark unsatisfying
this book is about harry &apos;s son albus and soo good it is .
my two friends have read this book and didn &apos;t like this book much and even one of them quitted this book .
so i was not much confident before starting this book but then i decided to read it ( i wanted to give it a try ) and guess what , my friends were wrong as i expected ( haha ! ) .
i loved this book and enjoyed reading it too and everyone , give it a try and i promise that you won &apos;t regret .
it &apos;s good but i have not gotten book mark
nice book
nice book
nice
nic book
they first delivered me a horrible book .. hell it was ... and after so many days like a month after i ordered the book , they delivered me the right book ... i m not going to order anything on flipkart ever
paper quality is good
pirated ! !
poor page quality
only harry potter fans can know its value
nice book
decent packing , but some pages were dirty
thank you flipkart
it was a good book with a cunning twist .
i suggest it to all the potterheads who seek more harry potter fantasy .
on the other hand , what was a bit disappointing was that it is a script not a normal book .
wonderful experience
its an awesome book .. its not just a book it will take you to a world of magic when you are in the book .. just loved it
great book for the potter heads , although it would be a lot more interesting if it had images , but all in all it was a great purchase , some pages have stain but keeping that aside it was a good purchase
nice book
the book is photo-copied .
not original .
very unfortunate for my little daughter who is mad about harry potter
good binding but in the book about 20 pages are missing so i expect flipkart to look to this matter seriously
very good
few pages are missing in between but otherwise story is really good
superb
jst lvd it ... fabulous ... grt harry potter fan
don &apos;t know about the book as i gifted it to my sister .
but the paper quality was not good at all .. seemed a pirated copy .
excellent relaxation while crucial work .
the story and the condition of the book both are terribly awesome .
you &apos;ll love it for sure !
and best for potterheads .
good
me and my family are addicted to books .. we buy books from both amazon and flipkart but we got best product from flipkart always ... recently we ordered harry potter &apos;s 1st part from amazon and harry potter &apos;s 2nd part from flipkart , we got 1st part duplicate i.e from amazon and 2nd part original i.e from flipkart .. printing of pages that we bought from amazon are like photocopy print from a faulty printer with omitted words , and cover is photocopied too ... huge difference in product ... by only ...
omg j.k. rowling you are really a great great great writer .
as usual some new adventures are there with ron &apos;s great humour and hermione &apos;s great brains . its a great book , go on reading the secrets will be revealed ...
came with a do not disturb tag and the packging was also good and what to say about the book by my favreroit rowlin .
buy , dont think
this is the second book of harry potter series .
i loved it .
harry potter is back to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry .
he suddenly starts hearing ecos and then many muggle- born turn into stone and then ... amazing book !
awesome !
just there is one thing i didn &apos;t like about the book .
it was that you just can &apos;t stop reading it .
very nice book .
just loved it
best book ever ....
this book is the best book i have read till now !
just love it .
jk rowling &apos;s imagination is so good that i felt all the things happening real . harry who has a great mind enters the chamber of secrets with his friend ron weasley .
ginny weasly opens the chamber .
very less people know that lord voldemort was once known as tom riddle .
flipkart service is awesome , delivered in one day .
well packed.book &apos;s quality was great compared to amazon .
timely delivery and good condition of the book .
awesome books best for fantasy lover !
really a very good product and service .
very interesting book and too light weight to carry out any where for use .
as dumbledore once said , &quot; it is our choices that show what we truly are , far more than our abilities .
my ability to write a proper review for this book does not exist , so i choose to leave it at five stars and two dobby snaps in a circle ; )
page quality is bad
excellent product worthy
this is not original book it is a cheap copy , the print is pathetic , sentences are misaligned and many words are not clear .
did not expect this from flipkart .
highly dissapointed .
lovely book !
i can never forget harry potter and the chamber of secrets .
it is so very interesting .
i could not resist myself and read the book in 1 day only .
flipkart service is very good .
the people who come to deliver are well mannered and decent .
price is also reasonable .
i love books with bookmarks .
bad paper quality
it was blank from inside
this books full of magic , love , friendship and togetherness it teaches moral values as well as tells stories of magic and fantasy .. just loved it ... now , i am looking forward to harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban ... reading any book of harry potter urges you to buy another one ... this books simply full of magic things and stuff which amazes us muggle readers ...
everything is fine .. and yeah i would suggest assured products are reliable than non assured ones
can &apos;t get my off from it .
good .
amazing .
as expected from flipkart .
excellent work outstanding book + fast service
superb product .... satisfied completely
this book is awesome once u start reading you cant even stop it .
i read the book three time and i am not bored of it .
it is very good fantastic
excellent service and product

thanks flipkart for giving me my lovely book harry potter .
the cover was in poor state ... although the book is awesome ....
this book is bewitched ! ! !
i &apos;ll have to take it to mr arthur weasley to get it done ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
superb
all about magic ...
need to pack the box in very good manner .
good delivery .
quick delivery within 2 days .
the cover and standard of pages r good .
it would be good if the size of the text was a little more .
the most lovely thing is the book is fat but not that much heavy .

you can easily buy this book from local seller for 400-450 ... dont order it from here sure flipkart offers some great deals but not on this one ....... just bought it from local seller for 410 with bill , , ,
must read
best
good
waiting eagerly to read this book and finally grabbed it on a good deal of 58 % discount .
the product was in perfect condition , packaging was good , got a bookmark also .
delivered within 3days .
overall highly recommended .
it is nice book
this might sound rude to many but this is my opinion .
i have read so many books based on mythology .
and hence bought this one .
i am quite disappointed with the content and writing .
most chapters are of 2-3 pages and hence break the flow of the story as a whole .
yes , breaks are needed to jump to other scenes but 78 chapters in 400 odd pages are too much i guess .
it seems like reading short stories collection which is merged somehow .
moreover , there are some vaguely written dialogues .
maybe not ...
this is a perfect read for you if you are looking out for &apos; a grounded fantasy book that takes inspiration from mythology &apos; as stated by the author in the first page of the book . each character is perfectly figured out and shaped throughout the whole process of story . there are some strong characters whom you look up in awe . the language is quite easy to read and it makes you grab the second book of this trilogy as soon as you finish ..
a very good book and purchase was also very good .
great book definelty go for it .
nice book
i got it delivered early and the cover is nice and the whole book vibe seems like the secret of nagas and the series , so if u r fan of them , give this a try .
good packing and delivered on time
well , the best book from an indian author so far .... the book revolves around a time of very old india age .
but the unexpected twist and gripping plot , cliff hangers , makes the book quite exhilarating from the very 1st page to the last . the plot changer was epic and you wouldn &apos;t never see it comming until mishal wants you to .
after completing the last chapter , you definately would want the second book for sure ! ! ! !
just an advice read this book after all parts comes out because you wouldnot be a ...
worst book
good
very lucid way writing
one of the best mythological epic .
story is good .. go for it.i have finished the whole series and it was awesome .
excellent book
i really like the book .
but the book edge &apos;s have small cuts i don &apos;t know why .
it &apos;s a very good story
nice
marvellous
excellent quality of book .
good fiction from writer .
nice product .
give it 5 *
fabulous
boring from page 1
for those who loved reading the shiva trilogy and anand neelakantans books ... the boom kalki doesnt match up to that much ... not much of a page turner ... it &apos;s strictly a personal opininion
page quality very bad worst book
thanks for bringing my order on time

havent read it all but u can purchase

amazing book
* lumos * i received this item within a day after i had placed my order and as for the book i simply couldn &apos;t resist myself from crying when i came across the true identity of snape .... &quot; &quot; a minute of silence for the actor , alan rickman &quot; &quot; .
every time i open the book my eyes get drenched in tears ...... &quot; always &quot; * nox *
as the guideline says , the rating and review should be about the product , i am giving 5 for the novel but 4 for the product .
i would like to highlight a specific point here .
paperback editions come with a hard paper cover with a higher gsm than the content pages inside , and it tends to get folded .
hence , the cover is creased along the binding margin while binding the book to prevent tearing of the cover from the binding edge while we read it .
previously , i bought 4 hp books , the binding was p ...
thank you flipkart .... this is a wonderful product here .
good work by j. k rowling i usually read on kindle but , this was the last part of the amazing harry potter series and i got it more quicker than i thought ....
i have already read 250 pages of this book .
if you thinking to buy this book you must ... what are u waiting for ?
go on order it and be a complete harry potter fan like me ...
thank u flip kart again .....
i even got 3 free exclusive flipkart bookmarks !
finally my collection is done
so glad to have got it all delivered on time .
i had been researching a lot about where to get this 2013 edition of the book .
and i &apos;m mighty impressed with it .
here &apos;s a tip- purchase it all together , that way you could get it at a cheaper price .
happy that the books are all original and in good condition .
the book needs no description as it will only be ordered by actual potterheads who will definitely know its worth ... so i &apos;ll just speak about the quality .. i ordered the book from &quot; truecomretailer &quot; and received an original piece .. it ws in extremely brilliant condition and was 100 % original .
please buyers buy only flipkart assured products in order to stay safe from sellers selling pirated versions .
and please raise your voice against piracy if you &apos;re victim of that.flipkart is always brillia ...
well .. no need to explain how good the book is .... its totally magical and the adventures never end .... p.s.will one ever read this book more than once ?
always ...
i have read this one before from a pdf format file .
good story .
hat &apos;s off to flipkart &apos; delivery .
received within 2 days in fine condition.but paper quality could have been better .

received these marvelous books today in perfect condition.i went through the books and found it pleasant to read the hobbit--- &amp; gt ; 75th anniversary editionthe lord of the rings ( 3 books ) ---- &amp; gt ; 50th anniversary edition but .. the map section is where its disappointment ... the maps are print in such a small font that its almost impossible to read through the characters detailed in the map .. the font is too small to read ... you can see the map but cant find any locations on it cause u cant read wh ...
unfortunately flipkart puts all the reviews of different editions together .
this is the 75th anniversary edition .
the one in the yellow box with a circled eye in the centre .
it &apos;s a really beautiful edition at the price it &apos;s being offered on this site .
the font is not small , as had been debated .
the hobbit is in an interesting matter velvet finish which is quite nice .
paper quality good .
design is great.maps are a bit of a problem .
there are two versions given .
the whole map on one page ...
nice packaging , all books in good condition , just go for it .
first thanks to flipkart for delivering the package well within the time-frame and in perfect condition . now about the books , this collection is must for anyone who loves fantasy .
if you still don &apos;t have it then hurry and buy this set .
also this set includes the hobbit - prelude to the lord of the rings , so you won &apos;t have to buy it separately .
no need to tell that this is best ever fantasy novel than any other and no doubt that jrr tolkien is the best novelist ever . i will advise to read th ...
previously i have read angels and demons by dan brown and later i have seen the movie . there is hell of a difference between the book and movie.everything is simplified in the movie . i then understood the power of human imagination by engaging it in reading books . i have seen the lotr movies and want to read the whole series and this box set is an awesome edition . i would like to thank flipkart for the awesome deals as well as the immaculate service they are providing to their customers .
i have ...
i just received the package from flipkart containing the boxed set .
it took less than 2 days to deliver and i am very much impressed by the speed and timing of the delivery .
the price was a very good bargain at rs.1109 and the shipping was free . now for the contents .
the box is very attractive and protects the books very well .
the covers of the books are exquisite !
they feature lovely designs in gold colour .
the maps were excellent ( especially in the hobbit ) .
i had already read the lord of th ...
best books with best delivering thanks flipkart
about the novels : this is one of the must reads that one can &apos;t just afford to miss .
the novel is a true masterpiece due to its story , thrills , action , adventure and above all , detail .
you &apos;re going to cherish it for the long time .
product : this 4 books set in a box was a luxury spend for me as i couldn &apos;t resist buying it seeing the great reviews and the legendary books which i hadn &apos;t yet read .
box is strong and sturdy while books are well printed with almost zero errors .
maps do lack quality ...
so books were amazing .. but the cover box was a bit torn and i really felt sad when i saw that .. font is very small in some of the books although it doesn &apos;t bother me but if you don &apos;t like small font than you should reconsider ... cover of the books are beautiful .
and i am really looking forward to read all these books .
i am really looking forward to read all these books .
this is a must have item in your personal library .
the hobbit &apos; and all the tree volumes of &apos; the lord of the rings &apos; in a box - you couldn &apos;t ask for better .
the books are very well printed and bonded .
they are well packed inside a sturdy box with artwork .
all the four books share a common design and style for their covers .
i really love those covers - they are printed in metallic gold paint and that in my opinion is a very nice thing for a book like this . but like some previous reviews said , ...
the font is too small for a comfortable reading experience .
otherwise , its an amazing concept and the book cover is to die for .
looks so beautiful on shelf .
but primarily , a book should do what a book should do .
received a set of 4 books in perfect condition .
these books are of original harper &amp; amp ; collins publications .
pages are not very smooth and bright , though .
fonts size is alright .
now , about the plot : the first book ( hobbit 1 , 2 , 3 ) is about the story of our favourite burglar little bilbo baggins his adventures how the mighty ring came to him ; and the remaining 3 books are the lotr series ; and has the story of the rings of power , his nephew frodo about and the king , dwarves and elves etc .
there a ...
everything about the box set of good except that some of the maps , being printed on pages , bear very small don &apos;t size , making it harder to see the details of the map .
it &apos;s a very good product
this is one of the best edition i have seen .
the covers are not movie tie-in edition .
that &apos;s the way books are supposed to be .
the fonts are little small to be honest .
the best thing is that it has lot of other interesting stuffs about the writer and the book related trivia .
one who is a extremely attached to lotr and hobbit will love it .
as many others have complained about the box being unable to accommodate the books after being used is true .
so is the problem with all the box sets of any ...
it was good with the price of 800
got it for only rs 808 ..... simply superb series .....
the packing quality was good , delivery time was ok ... but i can &apos;t imagine this series at rs 808 ....
thank u flipkart ...........
cover of this set and books are awesome specially the hobbit .
go for it , it worth the price .
have good amount of illustrated pages through maps and photos .
there is a another book just on illustration by jrr tolkien called &quot; the art of hobbit &quot; .
if you &apos;re looking to buy these books , then i won &apos;t waste your time by talking about the content .
you already know why you want them.about the product : the books are in perfect condition .
brand new and sparkling !
the cover art is lovely .
i compared it with previous editions like the 2009 harper collins and i find this to be a better product than that box set since i get &quot; the hobbit &quot; in this one too .
also , i found the maps and font size to be perfectly readable .
for lotr fans , this is a brill ...
finally , il be reading the lord of the rings the way its meant to be read ! !
! this product is really , really great .
the books have a beautiful gold embossing and look very elegant .
the print is good and although the maps &apos; print cud have been better , i wouldnt complain abt that cuz deyr still legible.what i really loved was the gold embossing .
the books look very very regal and of fine quality .
the books come in a nice box cover which is also very good lookingflipkart delivered the books wit ...
first of all , great service from flipkart .
ordered it on monday morning and got it next day in evening .
now as to the book , series starts with the hobbit .
although childlike and funny , this book provides a solid basis for the epic trilogy of lord of the rings .
the funnier shades of the hobbit are changed dramatically into the darker , more serious and grotesque tone of lord of the rings .
this series tells all of life joys and griefs , friendships , treachery and so on .
one has to truly read the ...
i won &apos;t be commenting much upon this prodigious set of books , which i had ordered a month back and received them soon enough .
came in perfect condition and packing .
as i see an assemblage of reviews already written for this product , i won &apos;t be getting into the minute facts .
i find a few people complaining about the maps though , their complain causing a bit of hiatus .
might just wait and think over .
though , the maps are a bit obscure at some places , they do not express ambiguity .
but , more ...
about the contents of the book : a timeless and flawless masterpiece . about the physical book and the box : i had placed the order on saturday and recieved it on monday afternoon .
i was surprised the see the flipkart guy at my home on monday itself but it was a pleasent surprise .
the case / box in which the books are placed is of sturdy and good quality .
the paper used in books is also crisp and a delight to read .
the cover of the books are decent enough but not mind blowing , but hey when you ...
had bought it as a gift to a family member .
wanted to read it too but other books kept me busy .
is lying at one corner of my book rack.but don &apos;t take it as it is not interesting - as everyone knows it is a great series .
even if you have just watched the films , the books are a must read .
jrr tolkien proves why this is the best of new fiction classics . the set is also quite neat and compact , and can actually be carried along in a long train or flight journey .
nice package .
cover page : black background with gold foil like writings and drawingsmaps : somewhat difficult to interpret but you can simply download one from internet to your mobile or tab and hence i think problem with maps is solved. everything else is as described by other reviewers ... i agree with those who say that you will not regert after buying this book ... yes , go for it and you will never regret ....
i don &apos;t know why flipkart delivered the worst packaging ever ! ! ! ...
two corners were torn about 3 / 4th part on the book set and the edges of one book is also a little torn ....
try to improve the packaging flipkart !
its really good worth buying
good books ..
the font size is a bit uncomfortable .
good book set .
but font size and paper could be better .
its very reddish in color.not happy with the print at this price
awesome book set
i like author writing style .
relating the character in story very fantastic .
when you read that book you will never forget any story of it .
i think i will buy further more book from this author
nice book
totally worth it .
just buy it .
i don &apos;t need to say how good these books are : we all know they &apos;re great .
the box set was worth the money i spent and i &apos;m thrilled to own it .
the only glitch is the font , which is really small .
apart from that there are beautiful maps and pictures in the book along with appendix at the end .
it &apos;s a must buy for all tolkien fans .
nice seriesawesome packed looking for fiction and mysterious book .
go for this
everything thing about is good except paper quality ..
don &apos;t forget the bookmarks flipkart ! ! ! !
! and protect the books with bubblewrap or something inside the box .
awesome ... font size could be a bit larger to facilitate smoother experience
excellent
good
packing box was damaged but i got the book in very good condition .... they sent me 7 bookmarks too. the books are very beautiful and lightweight.i loved the movies and i also love these books ... don &apos;t wait just go for it ... happy reading ...
original books of good quality .
looks classy , font is small though .
makes a very good read .
my daughter is loving the books .
great delivery service by flipkart .
astonishingly , the box was also in good shape , which is generally not the case when ordering box sets online .
the novels need no review .
the 50th anniversary edition covers are beautiful and the text is not very small either .
the quality of the maps is bit of a let down - but passable .
great piece of literature must buy .
print quality is not good
love it
the timeless classic doesn &apos;t need any review ! the boxset is decent !
got it for a great discount !
awesome buy
got it in very good condition .
the texts are smaller than expected .
but you would enjoy reading this series .
the box set was slightly squished in one corner ( hence 3 stars ) others this product is perfect .
awesome quality product with good pages : )
awesome box set , loved this anniversary editionit &apos;s a bit slow paced and boring if you are used to reading contemporary writersnevertheless a masterpiece
damn good book .. package was clean with no damage
came in perfect condition and quite early
i found this book very much slow and dragging for me .... bought this with a great expectations but now struggling to finish this
beautiful collection .. thank q flipkart
a good set to have !
wonderful story in a neat package .
a must read for all.the books and box although are good , but i feel the font is a bit on the smaller side .
but no way can it hinder the fun these books carry .
the novels were delivered in good condition and i am satisfied with the package handling of flipkart .
exactly what was promised
you should that the narrative style isn &apos;t what you would actually expect but the storyline and plot twist are awesome
outer box ( the one from harper collins ) was tornanother customer has reported the same thing does trucomm get a discount from the publisher for such torn boxes ? mrp is 1699 and i got it for 1060 , while other websites are not giving any discount at alleverything else with this purchase is good
oh boy , what a marathon read this was .
i &apos;ll look back to reading this series as a truly find memory .
the quality of the book is pretty as well .
the maps are okay .
but the story is amazing .
it was my dream to have this masterpiece in my collection .
got it in an unbelievable price ( under 900 ) .
i liked the edition and the page quality is very good .
worst book quality
enjoyed every moment
the books are excellently packed.pages are of first quality.the box is tight for all the books to fit in
good .
good
received this bookset in perfect condition without any tears or breakdown .
props to flipkart for the awesome packaging .
coming to the books , they are conveniently sized for carrying around , the text size is decent for reading under normal conditions and include all the maps of middle earth for proper referencing .
moreover , the books delighted me with the sweet smell which fresh books come with .
the only thing the package lacked was a bookmark .
the book is in a very good condition .
good ... but be sure that your brain would get muzzled by unpronounceable names if you &apos;re reading it for the first time
this is no doubt one of the best series .
i received the box set undamaged and in an excellent condition .
thank you flipkart .
worth it ...
books are in perfect shapedelivered in just 2 days
delivered timely and perfectly in good condition !
the books are splendid and i received them in a mint condition . my 12 year kid loved it the most and he already started reading his favourite first part hobbit .
i personally felt the font could have been a liitle bigger and darker .
i was initially reluctant to order after a recent bitter experience with flipkart ( i had ordered the alchemist and the print was improper ) , but the books were in excellent condition this time !
the print too was perfect .
kudos to flipkart !
received in good condition
awesome deal and amazing purchase excellent quality
the packing was not so good but the books were perfect.a must buy for a fantasy lover or just a book lover .
very awesome book ...... amazing , as we know about the story so ofcourse it is .... and yeah this edition is also really good
excellent as expected
great service !
beautiful book set !
thank you flipkart !
the box set was delivered in excellent condition .
all the books are in good condition .
although i read some things in the reviews about the map being vague to be understood and the words are too small to read , i don &apos;t think they are not entirely true if you &apos;re an avid reader .
great set of books .
got them in mint condition.thank you flipkart .
the book was awesome .
delivered right on time .
the box set in amazing .
it has 4 books .

good set of boks
loved it !
the box is so beautiful with such beautiful books !
feeds the hunger of imaginative minds
happy with the product
happy as i got a chance of getting a copy on it &apos;s releasing day itself .
also happy with flipkart &apos;s and the seller &apos;s service .
awesome plot so far .
very excited for the upcoming suprises .
each one of you will enjoy this as i did .
go for it , people .
what a great book , excellent writing from amish tripati.great to read the epic ramayana from sita &apos;s point of view. one word about amish is bow to you sir and respect
awsome nailed it again love you amishwaitimg for the raavan
not good packaging but the book landed safely to me !
thankfully .
excited to finish this book
this is a wonderful book ... better than the first one and now i cant wait for the third .. the story from sita &apos;s point of view is pretty amazing to read .. lots of twists and turns .. keeps the reader hanging from page to page ... some people might not like the detailed descriptions of the geographic locations but i actually love them .. so really love the author for going into detail ... i can literally imagine myself being there in that scene ... great work !
yet to read the book , so i &apos;ll review the book later ( of course this would be great ) ..
however i &apos;m giving one star to truecom retail and flipkart ... i &apos;m loosing my faith in flipkart ...
i &apos;ve been ordering books form flipkart since 2011 ... and they are downgrading with every successive book order ... i just received a book with torn pages ..
think , a person is ordering a book on pre-launch , means he &apos;s excited to get his hands on the book , means he wants to delve into the book ... and then he receive ...
nice book .
and am waiting for the 3rd book in ram chandra series
a continuation of the ram chandra series ..... a historic story presented in a vivid , practical way by amish ..... this book presents a different picture of warrior picture of the divine sita ( like sati in the shiva triology ) ... it can be considered an ideal example of women empowerment in the early days of the civilization ... hands off to the author
the book is really nice ...
i haven &apos;t started yet but the packing and condition of the book is really impressive .
but if the delivery is done within denoted time then it would rather be easier for us to collect our order on time .
my copy of the book was pirated with several pages completely blank and also missing .
totally bogus product !
not the original print ..
seems the first copy to me .
the book was not even cut proportionally .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s cheaper i guess .
in the name of fiction , author amiss playing with history .
by this way , the younger generation who has not red the original story of ramayana , will consider this one as original .
moreover , the fiction is very near to the original so someone with poor memory may consider this as the original one .
i am not going to buy other book of author amiss for sure .
got delivery before the estimated delivery date .
splotches of gum on the cover of the book .
quality of paper used is very poor .
the ink that is used to print spreads upon running fingers over it .
the printing is not aligned , few things like amish &apos;s website in the footer of the acknowledgements page are scribbled which clearly indicates that the book is a rough copy that was printed before the final one .
the pictures ( the coin with sita written on it in the first page of the book and ami ...
nice book .
great charecter story of lady sita .
definitely buy it .
good book .
i got it well packed , and i got it within 4 days
very good book because before buying i though all magics will be there that we are listing from childhood but the book is awesome because the sita character design and narration of story is like a real and it has happed with out any magic
i love the writer ...... osm book
excellent book
amish ji ... hatss of .
a masterpiece from amish ji .
i haven &apos;t gone through it completely bt will do it in the diwali vacations .
so by jst looking and persiving it i can tell u that u can order it anytime from flipkart .
quality is best .
a nice read ..
completed reading this book ...... got confused with the story initially , as i never got to know the other side of sita apart from being ram &apos;s wife ..... narration was good ..... the way how amish portrayed the characters is simple and clear
inspirational
awe man loved the book ... book 1 ram was also very very awesome .. an epic story about an epic journey seen through the eyes of an epic man and written by an epic person . how much more of an epic is it going to be ..... i look forward to it !
it &apos;s beautiful , the writer will lead you to a different world through his words ...
nothing bad about the content and the writer .. amish is awesome writer and i am big fan of all of his books ....
i was too excited when i bought this book but after started reading , , after few initial pages order of pages were not correct and it was all jumbled up but i still tried to read searching by page numbers but towards end of the book at-least 20 pages are missing , really disappointing .
better to buy some better place and pay extra bucks to get good quality original book .
book is yet to be read ...
but it will be awesome as always .. its amish tripathi &apos;s book ...
the one star less is because i didn &apos;t receive the preview book of ravan which is the third book of the series ... flipkart .. do have a look at it
time delivery , good packing
fantastic .
got it on the day of the releasing of this book .
if a book mark is given along with it .
it would have been better even more .
first of all i didnt liked the way the author explained the concept of next vishnus , malayaputras and vayuputras concept was uninteresting ... compared to &apos; scion of ikshvaku &apos;this book is boring that i literally skipped almost 30 % of the book ...
this book is worth reading .
the unfolding of the story is astonishing .
the character of sita as the warrior is bold and courageous .
some unpredictable things are there to be discovered and this masterpiece is one of the best creations of amish tripathy .
a fantastic book by amish sir ....
waiting for the next book eagerly .... hope to be released soon ..
great book.amish is a wonderful writer creating a fabulous land and characters with his imagination
no problems with the quality of packaging and with the quality of the book .
both were first rate , as always .
i gave it 4 stars because there were no bookmarks with it , as last time .
barring that , great service , as usual .
the second instalment in the ram chandra series is definitely more fast-paced and colourful than the rather &quot; grey &quot; first ....
many loose ends have been nicely addressed , but there are still more , and i am looking forward to &quot; raavan : the orphan of aryavart &quot; ..... hope it is even better !
page quality is very bad
average reading .
shiva trilogy was much better .
i saw the trailer and bought the book soon &amp; amp ; i my self couldn &apos;t believe that i read this story in 2 complete days of course its an honour to read the book and know our leaders in person credit is to sir amish that he departed this knowledge in exact series that we youngsters needed thank you so much amish sir that these books will change many lives to correct path at least i am motivated and influenced after reading about my mother sitabut i still am an agnosticthat will be till i nee ...
i am a fan of amish &apos;s books and simply love the style of his writing .
this book is even better than the first part and leaves you wanting for more.i absolutely the way sita is portrayed in it .
we have always known sita as a perfect womanly figure but in this book you &apos;re gonna see sita as a warrior princess who is fiercely strong , outspoken , and equally great as ram .
it &apos;s thrilling as the secrets of the previous book are unfolded and there &apos;s a lot more to look forward to in the third book .
sita ...
a nice and gripping book reflecting our ethos and values .
must readthanks amish
poor quality
nice
good
great book .
ram chandra series has a potential to make a &quot; book universe &quot; ( like the mcu ) connected to the events of scion of ishvaku under sita &apos;sperspective view .
griping story
the book is amazing ! !
but the quality is so bad
very good book !
!
quick delivery with good condition
exquisite and elegant in every aspect
nice book
page quality is not up to the mark ....
flipkart service as usual great .
got the book in good condition and properly sealed .
the story was engaging .. the suspence at last was good .
good
best
the product n the other standards of delivery r xcllnt so i gv 5 stars but if u ask me how the book is , i will say that this ram chandra series books of amish r nt of equal stature as that of shiva trilogy .
book is in very good condition
well , the book is good and the story is also good .
explaining the way the caves are , explaining the way palnts are etc are just to fill the pages and make the book look fat and they don &apos;t get any prominent place in the story
received in good condition .. paper quality is also good
fabulous
good
buy it if you are a fan of amish &apos;s writings
book received in good quality .
not read it yet but m very exited to read it ... cover quality is good and moreover i also got a bookmark ... though i was not expecting one ..
i loved this i

nice book
great book provided you read the previous one .
a very nice book .
it is a must read book .
worth reading .
amish sir is really a very nice author .
strongly recommended .
please guyz must read it once .
better skip this book , nothing significant is told in this .
about 50 pages are strictly copy-paste from ram
good
lots of same stuff from the previous part makes this book less thrilling could have merged it with first part only .
just awesome .
one of the best books
sweet story
must buy it.best book.excellent in condition.happy with seller service .

an amazing book , just no words .

one book that gives you a life changing experience . !
i am a bengali ; so , till now i have read authors like satyajit ray , sunil gangopadhay , sarat chandra chatterjee , rabindranath tagore etc .
, as the language being my mother-tongue .
advised by a friend of mine , i did start reading english books by indian authors as their language is what we say &apos; lucid &apos; . to start with , i choose durjoy datta and of his collection - &quot; till the last breath &quot; ; as the title hit me .
five people ( to me ) are most important characters and to elaborate and to weav ...
the way emotions are written are pretty well .
this was the book i just wanted to read as fast as i could read.just love the book .
the title of the story is just so apt .. &quot; till the last breath &quot; both for the story and the impact it has made in my life .
till my last breath i will always remember one thing that we should always be happy whatsoever happens in life .
our problems are always less compared to others and we should always be thankful for what we have .
this story shows this so amazingly .
the use of words is superb ! !
kudos .. !

not good
it is not just a love story .
it relates life of 5 people ... pihu , dushyant , armaan , zarah , kajal .... must read novel of durjoy .
it &apos;s by far the best book i have read which is written by durjoy dutta .
i love the personality of the protagonist pihu malhotra , a medical student suffering from a dangerous incurable disease .
and the way she was with dushyant roy , her hospital roomate .
this story is one of the best stories i have ever read .
5 star for the story .
4 star because there was no bookmark though .
still , everyone should read this story once in their life .
this story tells that life is not all about good rankings in jee / neet kind of exams .
the most important factor in our life is health .
the story is about an alcoholic and drug addict guy sharing common hospital room 509 with a very good and intelligent girl .
this book is such a good novel
nice book

within ten days i completed this book and i must tell u the only bad thing about this book is that it ends ... and it teaches u what it meant to b alive
awesome story ... much more worth than the money spent to buy it
outstanding ...
no need of review , it &apos;s harry potter ! for me , it &apos;s the best harry potter book . there &apos;s a bitter ending but an awesome storyline : ) not to reveal who but one of my favourite character dies in this book : (
very good quality
no need for reviews and intro .
it &apos;s harry potter .
just the name is enough for me .
again a mind blowing story from j.k rowling and probably the best in series ( according to me ) .
harry had a numerous of bad experience in this book .
including from quiddich to a tragic death of .... ( someone ) i won &apos;t tell .
but there are a lot of suspense in the story which are finally revealed at last .
to all harry potter fans - it &apos;s a must read.finally to flipkart .
the packing was so good that i thought it is a b ...
best book ever .
authentic product .
i have ordered this one bcoz its fassured .
i have ordered books before bcoz they were cheap but were not assured by flipkart so i ended up having a pirated copy . so in my suggestion you should always look for product assured by flipkart
well it &apos;s harry potter what more is needed .
if you read the book i m sure you will curse the movie makers to leaving out the details
everything is fine
love this ! harry potter mania can drive you mad .
very nice ..
it was in it &apos;s best condition and no issues
awesome purchase , got with a book mark too ... and delivery was on time as well ... so happy
came perfectly to my home so i rate it wonderful surprised !
harry potter &amp; amp ; the order of the phoenix is yet another masterpiece by j.k.rowling.
she has beautifully depicted the evolution of harry .
his dilemma as an adolescent boy , his love , anger &amp; amp ; other human emotions .
he is not presented as a conventional good boy .
he also has his own faults .
and also the portrayal of neville longbottom is very beautiful .
and thanks to truecomretail for careful delivery of the books .
this is my third time , i have ordered something on flipkart and as usual flipkart has never failed to keep their customers happy .
i just loved flipkart &apos;s one day delivery.the page quality is indeed excellent .
a must read book for every teen .
thank you flipkart .
this book needs no introduction whatsoever .
but i &apos;m here to review the service and the condition of the book .
it &apos;s great .
the book was delivered on time and is in good condition .
i purchased the entire set , so got it at a cheaper rate .
getting books at a cheaper rate is every book nerd &apos;s dream come true !
though the book is in amazing , but the way it was delivered made the outer cover very bad .
i would recommend people to buy this wonderful book from some other retailer and not from this one .
great products .
the binding , page quality and typesetting of the books are excellent and i don &apos;t think of any reason of mentioning how amazing the books are ! thank you flipkart !
the book needs no description .
loved this book .
everything is perfect .
i &apos;m very happy .
very good
amazing book .... another harry potter story for hp fans .....
nice product but flipkart should provide bookmark
very good book .
awesome story .
i am a big potter head

pages are not too thin and not too thick .
printing is clear .
very happy with the product .
i ordered the book from truecomretail seller and received it in a brilliant condition .

it just needs re-reads .
coz u wont ever get bored
nice
got in extremely low price @ 239 .
delivered very fast and the product was in first class condition .
this rating is not for the book but for my experience .
i never expected this from flipkart .
how much they made me suffer to get this one book .
they cancelled my order without my consent for god knows what reasons , they fave four reasons , a different one everytime .
but i didn &apos;t give up , and got the book at the end ..
delivery shoulda been faster
awesome !
this rating is for the product not the amazing story.4 stars as five pages of the book had small ( 2 inches approx ) tears in them .
but its nothing some fevicol cant take care of .
the cover is absolutely stunning and soft .
worth my money .
thankyou flipkart , i got so good quality of book .. pages are so good and the packing is awesome .

good but the words are too small
excellent
excellent ... the book was in a very good condition and nicely packaged .
worth buying ...
as always , harry potter books are so good .
it &apos;s the 5th part and things get more interesting .
and also someone my favourite dies in this book ( okay , won &apos;t reveal ... ) and i loved this book and suggest to every book lover to read harry potter series .
the book is excellent but the book i received had its golden paint coming out from the title .
man it &apos;s harry potter ..... no reviews required ..
i loved the book , but i gave 4 stars because one of the corners of this book was a folded , and creased .
and i couldnt smooth it .
a treasure like this , it makes me feel sad just because its a bit wrinkled.the novel is awesome anyway .
great book .
very interesting but the story is dragged to 800 pages so it becomes little boring .
otherwise great .
good product
harry potter and the order of phoenix ossum book and interesting character fast delivery of flipkart

always been a potter fan and really happy with the novel .
i loved reading it

great book and great shipping
amazing ...
i &apos;m a true faaaannn ....
great book .
very interesting and delivery is so fast and packing is good
nice
journey of harry potter through his third year was really amazing and the reader of course cannot predict the suspense .
harry potter needs no introduction also it is quite clear that the book series is really amazing and a definite pageturner from the first book itself
the book is flawless .
with the time turner and black &apos;s mystery the book gets all the more amazing .
it was in a very good condition.no pages were torn
harry potter is all time my favourite
very good book .
i love it so much that i also read it in exams .
this review is for the seller ( vivekbookshop ) , not for the book ..
the book is a knock-off ..
doesn &apos;t look like it was published by bloomsbury ..
i ordered the first 2 harry potter books frm some other website and they &apos;re a lot different from this .. one should only buy items from trusted sellers when shopping online ..
lesson learned ..
thankyou flipkart , i got so good quality of book .. pages are so good and the packing is awesome .
hello there !
i am very glad i found the harry potter series .
flipkart ( or i say the seller ) has done a very wonderful job in the packaging as well as the delivery of the book .
the book arrived in the perfect shape as well as pretty fast .
now i &apos;m in the process of reading it .
this is the authentic copy of the book ( harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban ) .
it also came with a cute bookmark ( i lost it already , lol ) .
i don &apos;t have anything bad to say about the book .
perfect in every way .
recieved the book on time .
got a bookmark also , cover is excellent , but the top of the book is little bit chipped .
otherwise its great
everything is fine about the product
awesome product ... good delivery
better than movie
must buy the book is really superb when i got it it was in a very good condition .
the book has a good stories and adventures of harry
i have got a pirated copy .
highly unsatisfied .
the book is one of the best books of the series .
it gives shocks .
when i came to know about the whole marauders friendship and also betrayl i was shocked .
its a amazing read and i reccomend every potterhead to read it .
its just awesome .
the book was so much of magical i have a whole set of hp books but this book was the best .
please do read it .
well it is great.recived in good condition and i totally recommend buying it .
i just loved it ....
front page and other pages are in very good condition .print is also very good.book has its quality . good one to gift someone.thanks flippant .
outstanding idea
everything is ok packing is good salesman is also polite
best ever book !
! please buy it .
it is far better than the second part of the harry potter series .
i also got a book mark with it .
it was amazing .....
a great book .
the book is just the printed version !
not the original bloomsberry book .
either ways hp is always the best .
what a book .
the suspense and thrill set out by jk rowling is unfathomable .
the book was great but the delivery should be faster
extraordinary book
fast delivery and good cover etc thank you flipkart
world &apos;s fourteenth most selling book .
the book is quite interesting to read but when i get it , it was in a bad condition . honestly it is very nice story but i am giving it 1 star because of it &apos;s late delivery.i did not expected this from flipkart
the quality of the pages is not good ...
the book tore from the seam within a few days hence reducing a star .
priced competitively vs others .
printing quality is not good in the more pages , not readable .
you all know that books such as harry potter need know introduction this book was as good as how i hope the next .
fantastic favorite and fabulous .
my favorite book for ever .
expecto patronas ! ! !
the best of my books
good quality and cover picture is also nice .
i didn &apos;t get a bookmark with it.earlier i always got one .

i am a big fan of harry potter franchise .
so this book does not any review .
the thing i want to say is that i recieved this book in very good condition .
it reached very quick
good
another spell-binding magical book from j.k. rowling ..... what i like best about the book is definitely draco malfoy &apos;s character ....
he &apos;s at his vulnerable best in this book with lord voldemort setting upon him the task of killing professor dumbledore .
the trials and tribunals he undergoes is worth a read .... now coming back to our protagonist , harry undergoes the usual problems of adolescence ....
he shows a lot of temper and also a lot of passion ...
he finally gets into a relationship with g ...
best part of the series
product came in time ..... quality is just awesome and it also came with a bookmark . this is the first time i have bought a book from flipkart and am sure i &apos;ll be doing more as the products are original as far as literature is concered .
the quality is very nice and has attractive cover designs .flipkart kept its promise of undefected products .
check out for the bookmarks .
one of the best versions of harry potter books .
the only thing wrong with it is that you can &apos;t stop reading
just one word to describe it : amazing ...
i got tfios bookmarks when i got those bookmarks i was feeling top of the world ...
thank u flipkart
awesome as usual .. expected from flipkart .. harry potter is a must read always ..
it came propely with a perfect protection and a free bookmark also came ..
it reached 2 days early ..
i &apos;m very happy ..
thanks flipkart ..
a superb piece of writing ... dumbledore &apos;s demise , snape &quot; s treachery--- all so delicately portrayed that it is impossible to put it down once started .
it &apos;s thrilling &amp; amp ; thoroughly enjoyable .

i am a big fan of harry potter franchise .

i have ordered all my hp books on flipkart but this time the packing was not enough ... i expect more from flipkart though ...
i &apos;m very happy with both the product and the delivery !
!
it is book that contains all the information for the next sequel , which is the deathly hallows .
harry fits gallantry to fight the battle with voldemort .
this book tells the surreptitious life of tom riddle and tells about horcruxes and what they might lead to .
harry gets a crestfalled death which i am keeping as suspense .over all i will recommend this book to all potterheads .
quick and intact delivery .
satisfied .
the best book of the harry potter series
i received a bad pirated copy of harry potter and the half blood prince which certainly is not the original bloomsbury copy of the book .
i am very disappointed with flipkart and its seller king books .
i wanted to gift it to a friend which i cannot now .
i have bought a number of things from flipkart before , but this was a totally bad experience for me .
the seller king books should further take care to not sell such pirated books .
i am going to return the book anyway .
i still cannot understand ...
the book is amazing .
i enjoyed it .
harry potter is a fantastic character .
just fab
awesome quality ..
superb cover hilarious writing .. love hp .. and yeah quick service
a book which i can read a thousand times over and then again .
yes it is that much enchanting .
an epitome of a epitome of books .
product delivered was in perfect condition .special thanks to truecom retail . they are trustworthy .i bought two books together one is goblet of fire and half blood prince.both were in good condition . so i am very happy.good job.but i want to request flipkart for giving us the chance for uploading our pictures in review.please
the book is not original .
it &apos;s a fake copy .
i have original books of this series .
but we can read it .

no need to say about j.k rowling &apos;s books .

i was not really happy with the price
heart touching story
good book at best discount price .
was a good product
great .no doubt
it has all the details that the movie missed.i would recommend it to everyone .
just go for it .
# it has enough elements to keep you hooked until the end .. probably this is a trilogy .. .nice reletable plot but at the end it was overcooked &amp; amp ; is way too filmy at bits ... nevertheless a good read .. ! !
beautiful book sequel i had ever read ... at the last it comes with a twist which makes me more curious abt the next part .. maybe it will come later ..
after reading this book am in luv wid raghu ganguly but i just hate it &apos;s ending .
it could have been better !
but it wasnt a signed copy
amazing books with a complex ending .. should prefer reading once .
awesome book , but first part was more awesome
liked it lot reached faster than expected
perfect&apos;
awesome ..
you just cannot keep this book down .
you &apos;ll keep guessing what happens in the very next page ..

3 ) camera : omg it &apos;s superb for this price check the images 5 / 5 . 4 ) performance : 5 / 5 i &apos;m a normal user &amp; amp ; don &apos;t play highend games so i bought 2 / 3 2gb variant , the performance is snappy and multitasking is smooth but
as per me this cellphone contains all the things in such range simply superb

beast in the market .
first time i am using redmi phones and i am happy with its design , speed and performance .
everything is perfect except battery is draining fast .
i have seen people are not happy with camera quality but i don &apos;t see issue with that at this price ( i am not saying this is the best camera quality ) .
just clicking on camera button can &apos;t give you best 4 8 megapixel picture , it totally depends on skills of the person behind the camera .
camera settings are customisable use it as per
pros 1 . the pricing .
you won &apos;t find a phone this fast , with camera set up this good anywhere else right now .
2 . did i mention how fast this phone is ?
multitasking is a breeze .
haven &apos;t faced any lag in any games .
and the phone didn &apos;t heat up that much either .
it did get warm , but it was barely noticeable .
3 . camera set up no , the picture quality is not as great as pixel 3 , but what other phone is ?
almost as good as s10 + ( i did have to go to the settings and turn down the saturation from

nice phone , i gifted this to my mom , she &apos;s very happy receiving it .
camera is quite good not like the high end ones but class at it &apos;s price , battery backup pretty nice , when she unpacked it the charge was 3 8 % after that i had to get all the apps installed on the phone and restore the backed up images and many other things which took more than an hour and i was on jio fi , the battery reduced to 2 9 % after everything was done .
the best thing i liked about this phone was the remote app , i was ab

first of all , value for money product .
using this for few days pros : .
spectacular display .
single hand use is easier than i expected since its a gigantic six inch display .
but the cover they gave us free .
is a bit slippery ( good quality material though ) .
better battery perfomance .
engaging ui : everything you want to do is right there and tweak / clean apps already there .
great signal reception .
speaker is loud enough makes some rattling noise when i play 1 2 8 kbps files , but thats normal right ?
brilliant mobile .
i loving it .
awsm phone , really fast .

inshort a all rounder phone in this price segment 🥄 .

i purchased the 6 4gb varient and i &apos;m reviewing it after a few days usage .
the battery back up of good and lasts for 1 . 5 2 days on normal usage .
i played a couple of games and found no lags .
the front camera is nice and clicks good selfies .
the main camera is good however the low light performance is not good .
the pictures slightly distort when clicked in low light conditions .
when you zoom in the image clicked on low lights , you can see the pixels breaking up .

key highlights : class leading battery life , ergonomic design and compact form factor , excellent price to performance ratio , average camera performance in lowlight situations .
verdict : the xiaomi redmi 3 s prime is the best smartphone to buy under ₹ 10,000 .
while xiaomi may want to highlight the fact that it is assembled in india , or that it performs better than its competition , this phone &apos;s battery life is the best thing about it .
the redmi 3 s prime can easily last a full day for even the m
overall phone is very good .
( 8 / 10 ) speed is awesome ( 8 / 10 ) camera is average ( 7 / 10 ) battery life is fabulous ( 10 / 10 ) audio is good ( 9 / 10 ) video can be better ( 7 / 10 ) ir blaster not works properly ( 5 / 10 ) fingerprint sensor is so quick ( 9 / 10 ) price is the best ( 10 / 10 ) voice quality is good ( 8 / 10 ) display is fine ( 8 / 10 ) i really want all people to go for this if you have limited budget of under 10,000 inr .
its really worth to carry .
i am exploring the phone day by day .

first of all a nice budget phone .

totally the mobile is good .
also flipkart &apos;s delivery is awesome .
please don &apos;t belive in 1 star reviews stating weird reasons like screen is small or that you only get 2 5gb free for the 3 2gb model .
a message to the people who posted 1 star reviews : seriously ?
have you guys ever used a smartphone ?
no smartphone ever manufactured has all its storage empty , take any 3 2gb smartphone in the market and see for yourself , at maximum , it may have 2 5gb free .
and the screen is small ?
really ?
they already mentioned it has a 5 inch screen .
how foolish can you be not t

well done xiaomi ) if you are planning to buy a good battery phone .
then this is the best out there .

but overall its gud in this price range .

very nice phone but camera clearity
camera and all are best fbut it &apos;s hanging aftr some time .
i dont know why .
may be some of my flirting with this .
handset is good .
but camera and pixels are not so good and performance and battery backup is also good .
redmi note 7 is better than this phone and only 6 7 5 rupee more than that

you get a priority over other customers .
awesome service flipkart .
truly valuable here goes a long awaited review xiaomi ( shao me ) mi3 . the story about me and mi 3 i was in a dilemma to buy this phone .
i was just waiting for s5 price to drop .
i received an email from flipkart regarding the mi phone stating that i can buy this phone one day prior to sale date i .
e 2 1 st july even while buying , i was bit confused to decide .
n
hello all , i started looking for a smart phone when my wife lost her phone and my eyes fell on mi3 advertised on flipkart .
i am currently using nexus 4 and this mi3 is direct competition to nexus 5 in terms of specs or its even better in some aspects like camera and battery capacity .
being skeptical , i still registered for purchasing this mobile as i trusted flipkart brand name .
my online research summary on mi brand and xiaomi :
while the pros are many in this phone there are also a few cons .
i will list them up .
cons : 1 . sim card tray is notoriously difficult to open .
i almost thought of returning it back as i couldn &apos;t open the tray .
however few attempts and a lot of force later it finally opened .
2 . the phone gets heated up if you keep it in charging and update the software at the same time3 . the back looks premium but due to the flat design .
it tends to slip also please note the proximity sensor works when you r
i bought two of these beauties , somehow was lucky to get hand on two .
one for my wife and one for my friend .
now after thoroughly grinding both the phones here is my review : pro &apos;s1 ) build : quality is awesome , top notch with the likes of iphones and lumias .
if you are a samsung phone user like me till now , you will hold the phone in your hands with the same reaction gollum gives after he has the ring in the movie lord of the ring &quot; my preciousss ! ! ! ! &quot;
one hand using is effor
hey guys , i did manage to have an early access and got my hands on xiaomi &apos;s flagship model mi3 day before yesterday and thought i &apos;d share my experience with others .
this is 100 % my experience and 100 % true .
so , let &apos;s begin .
the good stuff about mi3 what i liked most about mi3 is the fantastic display , awesome user interface , and amazing performance .
the device is faster than you &apos;d imagine my previous phone is samsung galaxy 7 &quot; 7 imported ; games and apps that hang in that phone are playing
hi , my earpiece still gets heated up when ever i take a photo or video , even a short one for a minute .
i have tried doing a factory reset , updating the software and also changing factory settings .
i got a mi3 during the first sale .
as i was facing an issue with the earpiece getting heated up whenever i take a video i requested for a return .
i requested for a return .
it &apos;s been three days and i still have not heard back from the technical team .
this is my first shopping experience with flip cart and i am extremely
bought on 4 august 201 4 , written this review on 7 th june 201 8 with same phone .
one of my best purchase yet
switched to the mi3 from the moto x .
although , it isn &apos;t nearly as perfect as the x , it &apos;s a near perfect device for the value it offers at the price it is being sold .
display : bright , crisp and clear .
won &apos;t go into any specifications but the touch is responsive and the text clear .
the fonts tend to be slightly clunky .
although the size can be adjusted there &apos;s something that still feels weird about it .
camera : i don &apos;t really use the camera much but it &apos;s an efficient shooter .
tends to exaggera

good quality mobile
osm
best phone in its class .
very smooth processing .
touch is very good .
after updating the phone the heating problem is very less in comparison to redmi 2 . 2gb ram is huge for this phone .
only 700mb of is used by miui .
the rest is more than enough for multi tasking and heavy gaming .
lags found in redmi 2 are overcome in redmi 2 prime .
no much difference in redmi 2 and prime except ram and internal memory .
dont think .
juz go for it if ur budget is less than 10k .
its perfect for d money pa
after 4 months full use , like made in india mobile as expected , camera outstanding front as well as back , in day / night both .
better than other 1 3 mp while it has only 8 mp , rank second after apple , battery backup is good .
internet connectivity superb , fast charging , various colour light led notifications , display this device deserve 10k in price go for it .
only one con that call quality over 2g network is average and little bit mic issue occured some times
redmi 2 prime is what gives the term vfm meaning .
not that redmi1 s and redmi 2 were not vfm but this one takes it to whole new level offering 2gb ram with 1 6 gb onboard storage , dualsim 4g connectivity and 6 4 bit chipset .
ordered the product on 10aug under the exchange scheme and 10 % cashback with citibank card and got the product delivered today much ahead of the expected delivery date ( 1 9 th aug ) .
so good job flipkart .
being an mi3 user , i can say this product will definitely meet a regu
this is my 1 st budget handset bought with the purpose of backup for emergencies .
i own a note 3 at present along with a nexus 5 and an iphone .
man , i am impressed what i have got with the money i paid .
i exchanged an old htc wildfire i had lying around which got me 1000 rupee &apos;s off and also citiback 10 % cashback of rs 600 .
hence , i got this phone for rs 5 400 .
as i am writing this review i got this phone today morning and spent almost 2 hours with it .
i find no flaws bluetooth , wifi , 4g
fully customization available in the ui , os is awesome , with the hardware good in specifications , camera front &amp; amp ; rear both excellent the ui , speed , screen , everything makes you fall in love excellent battery backup , performance and awsome camera .
need i say more ?
xiaomi gives a best phone at 7 k .
battery is very good and no heating issue , otg supported and many more .
flipkart fast delivery is very nice at 90 rupess .
overall the phone is excellent at all modes
well , it &apos;s after a thorough ( rather long ) research , i have finalized on this mobile .
my criteria : 2gb ram ( to accommodate decent apps as well as good response ) , good battery , sleek in design and handling as well as top notch music .
i have figured out below devices for my parameters : 2gb ram : lenovo a6000 plus / yu yuphoria good battery : yu phoria sleek design : lenovo a6000 plus good music : lenovo a6000 pluswhile the other factors on lenovo was promising , its ui ( i really dont like
its been 2 days using this phone , touch is smooth , display is good , pictures &amp; amp ; video quality is decent .
build and design is smooth .
screen mirroring &amp; amp ; otg is supportable .
sound is also good with good volume .
the only thing noticeed is that the phone gets heat up while charging .
otherwise its a very good phone 6 9 9 9 /
came with excellent packaging thanks to flipkart .
built quality is premium of this device , excellent call quality .
dual sim 4g , 3g works topnotch .
camera quality is excellent if you know how to take pictures : ) playing games is a bliss .
i have installed trine2 , leo &apos;s fortune , yurei ninja , monument valley , asphalt8 , fruit attacks , angry birds 2 , plants vs zombies 2 . thanks to 2gb ram and 1 6 gb rom .
everything is smooth no lags .
battery is a plus point , with quick charging tech i can charge
i am writing this review after seven days of use .
i agree fully with all the favourable comments made by the reviewers here .
so instead of repeatation , i like to add some pertinent points i gathered after detailed use of the features of this phone .
firstly , this phone supports micro sim slot .
so , if you have regular sims , you have to take them to a local store who will slit the sims &apos; edges after which these can be inserted into the phone &apos;s sim slots .
remember if you wish to reuse these sims

people who know me know that i &apos;m not a fan of apple phones , especially after having used them .
earlier , i use to compare my moto g ( 201 3 ) with it and favoured the moto g .
i also have a moto e which is also good for its price , though i &apos;ll put it equal to the i os based devices from apple .
now , i got the redmi 2 in the first flash sale from flipkart and they delivered it in 3 days .
good .
and i &apos;ll now ask apple to beat this .
features : excellent .
like high end androids .
there are lots of setting
after hearing so much about redmi 1 ; .
took the redmi 2 but this phone is very delicate .
and most importantly delay while opening any application lot of lag in response .
its acts like very old phone .
and voice brakes frequently disappointed with product , even after troubleshooting there is no improvement i would suggest not took any one .
the back panel is just like paper think ness .
it wont sustain for .
surely it will damage the batter is its fallen why flip kart selling faulty
i have been using a moto g ist gen .
last week it fell down and the display cracked .
opted to buy a new phone and zeroed in on redmi 2 based on the good feedback for redmi 1 from a friend .
pros : excellent build quality perfect size and form factor brilliant and crisp display good battery backup will last for atleast 1 2 1 4 hours with moderate to heavy usage cons : slow ui transitions not smooth when you press the home key from any other screen , a please wait is shown saying loading lau
pros : good battery backupbright display ( ips ) good internet speedoption to free ram no lagging while playing high end gamesgood touchcamera good ( both ) cons : speakers sound loud but not up to the mark no gorilla glass , handle with care built in quality ok but not greatheat while play but not muchfinally i am satisfied because i got it for 5 . redmi 2 is a brilliant device from xioami considering the specs and performance at ?
6 9 9 9 its no doubt that this device is capable of competing against those mid rangers in market which charges more and gives ugly specs and worse performance ( m pointing at you samsung ) so in my daily usage here are some pros and cons i noticed pros : 1 ) gorgeous display ( 1 2 80 x 7 20 ) saturation level of redmi 2 is good and balance nicely with contrast levels2 ) good battery life , i mean its not the gre
if you really care of your money don &apos;t buy this mobile .
its heat too much like redmi 1 s .
during call mic volume is not good .
only look is modified when compare with redmi 1 s .
heating is still there like redmi 1 s .
harware is good but miui is not good .
ram is also too low .
multitasking is horrible .
pure chinese product .
dont waste your hard earn money on this shit kind of device .
the device has a premium look and doesn &apos;t feel like an entry level phone in any angel .
the display is beautiful and smooth .
the rear 8 mp camera is as awesome as that was in redmi 1 s but the impressive part in camera section is the 2 mp front cam which is just awesome in this price range .
sound output is good .
another noticeable difference of this phone with redmi 1 s is that the device is much lighter and is smaller than redmi 1 s the screen size remaining same and feels good in hand .
device is
1 8 : 9 is best ever improvement .
i just love it !
nice phone
best product of mi great specifications , best display of this price range love u milove you flipkart for great service
super phone love it &amp; amp ; like it

first of all 5 for fk , fast delivery within 2 4 hrs .
great , keep it up .
now come to mobile , let &apos;s see .
( 1 ) display is clear &amp; amp ; bright with fhd but tall one due to 1 8 : 9 ratio .
if you are using for first time it will take some time to adjust it , then afterwards no problem .
so 9 / 10 ( 2 ) battery is great , 4000 mah is easily last for 2 days with moderate to heavy usage .
so 10 / 10 ( 3 ) sound is average from speakers , not at all loud .
disappointing , actually it should have dual speakers as cost is 10k .
this is awsome phone , better than resmi note 4 , pros .
1 . very good display , viewing angels are great .
2 . snapdragon 6 2 5 is a great energy efficient chip , you can play every types of games , like asphalt 8 , modern combat 5 , gta v with no essue .
3 . camera quality is beter than note 4 , wide angle is pretty good .
4 . so .
this has a 4000 mah battery , it s one time charge give you 2 days battery back up .
5 . built quality is very good , curved edges are give you easy to handle the ph

it will solve the heating issue etc .
looking very beautify and also looks very slimcamera is goodvideo recording is also goodscreen resolution is very good mi ui 6 is so goodmobile performance is also goodbut little bit heating issue .
this phone is excellent in terms of style , performance , battery and camera .
too weightless and had a mat finished like back panel cant say that this device didnt heats up .
actually it does .
but only when you are charging or using mobile internet .
miui is as fluid as iphone .
in fact its superior with a lots of features ; like &quot; one hand use &quot; , themes etc the only con i had found is that the sound is only average ( or below average ) .
display and camera are excellent .

overheating ?
i was initially concerned about the reports of overheating from reviews on fk as well as from some reviewers .
after using the phone for a few days i have not experienced any overheating .
like all phones , it gets a bit warm if you use it while charging and also for highly intensive games .
but even during gaming , it never got too hot , just slightly warm .
this is on asphalt 8 , subway surfers and clash of clans .
design : the device feels extremely great in your hand , even better th
issues with the phone .
1 . led leak at bottom of the screen , under the backlit buttons .
2 . phone overheats even with brief usage on 3g / wifi .
have requested for return .
waiting for reply from flipkart .
phone is pretty good ! ! !
! no abnormal heating and the heat it generates is normal for a phone of this kind ! !
! first xiaomi product ! ! !
happy with the performance ! ! !
camera beyond my expectations ! ! ! !
total worth for money ! !
! only concern is service centers ! ! ! !
hope ill not get any issues atleast for an year until i get another one ! ! !
please don &apos;t buy this product .
its like a heating pad .
i just started setting up the phone on first boot up the phone got heated up and it is really unbearable to use .
here is what you need to know about the phone before you purchase : the good : 1 . amazing display with display calibration and color gamut found in apple hardware .
the sunlight readability works as advertised .
2 . well built with antislip matte back and very light weight .
easy to hold and won &apos;t drop too often unless you are butterfingered3 . &apos; flagshipgrade &apos; rear camera with quick focus , good hdr mode and great details and colors .

mindblowing phone
fully satisfied
1 ) display is nice .
full hd + screen is very bright and colors are accurate and crisp .
2 ) glass back feels premium .
3 ) notch is very tiny , it looks nice but as of now while writing this review miui has no option to hide the notch yet .
i know many people would like to disable the notch .
in future through software update may be xiaomi would fix this .
4 ) sound quality is okay .
not great and not bad .
5 ) software : android pie out of the box with miui 10 . 6 ) security patch level is of 5 1 201 9 o
awesome at this price
very good phone i like very much
awesome .
verdict : the xiaomi mi max is big ; big on entertainment , performance and size .
it is a great device for media consumption .
while some may find it a bit large , if a big screen phone is what you seek , the mi max is a very good smartphone to choose .
key highlights : great display for viewing content smooth performance feels premium excellent battery life no heating issues phablet sized ( 1 7 3 . 1 x 8 8 . 3 x 7 . 5 mm ) average camera performance in lowlight conditions the experience : clearly meant
it is so good everything is max its screen size is superb please buy this phone only
very good phone
just like redmi note 3 bada bhai , love multimedia experience on it .
good product with prompt delivery .
only problem with the device is that there are no screen guards available in the market to fit the size .
all available screen guards cannot cover the 2 d glass curve at the corner .
very nice phone .
: : : mi max full review : : : mi max is a massive phablet .
it is a clear winner in this segment .
reviewing after 3 months of usage .
bought on open sale july .
with 4g on all time and im multitasker and i get an whole day battery .
no lags during multitasking .
gaming is really good on this device .

awesome phone .
trully a beast in this category .
using since 3 months .
had no issue at all .
go for it guyss .
u wont regret
happy with this mobile .
now when do you write such a heading ?
well , when you have used a plethora of devices of that specific brand and when you know it &apos;s unbeatable .
xiaomi my 1 st phone was redmi 1 s , 2 nd redmi 2 prime , 3 rd was mi4 i and current is the one i am reviewing about .
with each devices i used xiaomi has always surprised me a little more than i expected .
it &apos;s actually normal in india , to always have a bad feeling associated with any chinese branded product .
but gradually it &apos;s being scaled down day by
positive : 1 . nice looking sleek phone2 . nice display3 . no major call connectivity issues4 . cool miui features5 . battery back up is good .
6 . picture quality good .
7 . cool fingerprint sensor negatives : 1 . bad software failing gps locking most of the time ( irritates most if you are using for navigation ) .
reduced my star rating from 5 to 3 as the gps is creating a major setback .
certainly a deal breaker .
2 . touch resolution is not so great .
tapping on small buttons ( eg .
close button ) doesn &apos;t
pros : 1 . good camera2 . camera speed is too good3 . good built4 . very good battery5 . mi ui is so smooth6 . super fasting charging .
7 . screen clarity is super .
waiting for miui 8 updates .
cons : 1 . night time camera pic are just ok .
the best phone in this range .
it &apos;s super light and best in this range .
remember this phone doesn &apos;t have expandable memory .
i phone also don &apos;t have it .
and the advantage of that is , if you have expandable memory you end up dumping unnecessary stuff in your phone and eventually slowing it up .
this non expandable feature will make you back up the data .
which is a good thing .
battery is good .
camera is excellent .
i am impressed with this phone
you cant ask for a better phone for such a low price .
no problem with the h / w or s / w ; both are amazing .
i &apos;m glad i waited long for the black version .
great value for money .
most surprising thing was that phone was light ( as compared to my older phone note 3 ) quite snappy and feature rich and feel solid in the hands .
but its too slippery .
slips from hands and almost every place with a little incline .
a cover and screen guard is needed .
software : miui 8 is good .
light , fast and beautiful .
hi guys .
let me give you honest review after using this phone almost for a month .
i have bought mi5 black and so my designing review is purely based on the black model .
designing and build quality : it is a awesome experience when you get a product in nicely packed box , with charger .
the black color and sliver thin edges looks really premium .
perfectly build with black and gray on the rim .
i am not exaggerating , but this phone is better than high end phones which come around 4 5000 +
phone is good in terms of technicalities bt only couple of problems been observed .
1 . phone gets heat up quickly2 . external memory can &apos;t be extended3 . charger quality is quite poor
awesome phone , recently converted from i phone , but after start using this mi5 never felt like missed i phone .
instead of spending 40k50k on i phone better buy this camera quality is too good
review after 8 months of use bad1 . phone has a genuine heating problem .
2 . extremely slippery back3 . miui isn &apos;t that great .
4 . speaker sound is average5 . display developed a strange patch .
6 . in short its a chinese product .
good1 . looks good .
2 . ideal size3 . display clarity is good .
4 . fast charge works 5 . battery life is decent6 . call quality is as per expectations final verdict .
avoid it
nice phone i love mi mobile thanks for flipkart
ordered on 2 7 th july &amp; amp ; delivered on 2 9 th at my office in ernakulam .
superb battery backup , camera not met the expectations .
sound also need much improvementswifi signal capturing is low beyond 10m ( with my 3 day experience ) system performances are goodbig screen , but handy
excellent phone in this price range .
pros : large screenlarge storage ( 6 4gb ) and 4gb ram5 300mah battery , single charge can extend upto 2 days of extensive usagefast chargingno significant heating on heavy gaming and net brousing cons : front cam is below average and low light photos are pathetic , perhaps the weakest point of mi max 2 back cam is also average performerback panel s finger print magnetnot for small handsback cover / flip cover is a must as the phone tends to slip from grip
mi max 2 is full entertainment package with6 4gb of internal memory4gb of ram with snapdragon 6 2 5 and andreno gpu which makes phone run smoothly .
and 5 300 m ah battery providing ling lasting backup .
i am using mi max 2 from 2 weeks overall performance is good and this is good phone with good features in this price range
definitely a must buy if you are looking for power packed battery phone .
this phone really goes beyond expectation .
reviewing after using it for almost 7 months .
its just wow .
it has everything .
all best features you can get at this price .
i saw some bad reviews abt camera but i think it has one of best camera n focus .
uploading images taken from my mi max 2 . jst go for it if screen size is not problem for you .
its huge bt best also for watching videos n movies .
loving it
awesome product .
great delivery ! !
the phone is good .
builtin quality .
touchpad .
no issue at all .
bt camera could have been better .
otherwise superb
initially before ordering i was worried for the snapdragon 6 2 5 processor .
coming from nexus 6 with 805 processor this seemed to be a downgrade , but after using the mi max 2 i was speechless .
the 1 4 nm architecture is really awesome .
the battery life is phenomenal .
i can use this one as much as i want really without having the tension of depleting the battery before i reach home from a trip .
both cameras are good enough for well light conditions .
don &apos;t expect
i am giving the review after two months of continuous use and not influenced by any add or anything .
i am giving here what i totally experienced with the two months of use .
i purchased it mainly because of big screen and large battery capacity .
before purchasing i have heard that the set is not pocket friendly and won &apos;t be put in the pocket , but that &apos;s not true .
if you are wearing jeans and trousers then you can easily insert it in your pocket .
i am riding 3 5 km daily by putting it in the
pros : mindblowing and lethal combo of hardware and software .
huge 5 300 mah battery easily last for 101 1 hrs on gps and display on , hv roamed all around goa with gps of this device .
cons : camera and build quality could hv been better but considering the price tag its not tht bad too .
advice : go for this device friends but take ultimate care and dont let device to fall and dont forget to buy mi insurance along with device offerd by mi .
device is very very vulnerable , even a 2 feet fall c
prob .
phone gets hot or &quot; heating problem &quot; sol .
go to settings , advance options , battery , battery mode and turn on the battery saver mode .
note : performance mode consumes a lot of hardware this caused heating problem thus prevent this option during light operations like browsing , chatting .
don &apos;t worry each phone get &apos;s little hot during use .
if you find this review helpful please support it so other buyers can solve their problem .
thank you !
gets hot , heavy , get smudged , average looking .
nothing great about it .
less battery .
definitely overpriced .
no 4g .
oneplus is better deal .
i have used mi3 for almost one year , then i purchased mi4 i and used for 2 months and then when i found price drop in mi4 i decided to buy mi4 : ) and gave my mi4 i to my sister .
bunch of thanks to flipkart for big app shopping days .
i purchased this phone in 1 2 , 5 9 9 / only .
i will compare all three phones &#91; mi4 i , mi3 &amp; amp ; mi4 &#93; as i have used them enough to know its performance and all .
display : in terms of display i would say mi4 i display is bit better then mi3 &amp; amp ; mi4 . still mi4 have far better di
absolutely no heating problems !
i am beginning to think they are all paid fake reviews by competitors .
bought this phone , because of its good community support .
mokee and miui dualboot is an absolute treat .
also you &apos;ll get windows 10 build later this year .
for 1 1 k ( exchange + sbi + appday ) it was a steal .
also the processor sd801 , sd6 1 5 in terms of performance and benchmarks , so naturally avoided mi4 i .
moreover 4g will take another 3 years to get coverage and affordable , the current 4g
mi4 is awesome in camera and some other features .
but with 3gb ram the performance of mi4 is not to my expectation .
while playing subway surfers game in mi4 the game is strucking .
please test the mobile while buying don &apos;t be hurry like me .
here is my experience with this device .
i bought this phone on its first sale .
then after facing some issues i send the replacement request to flipkart .
again i checked all its functionality also i checked the phone of my friend but following issues are common in all .
1 ) its camera gives greenish and yellowish effect when we use its flash light specially in room light condition or in no light condition .
it will make your face fully yellowish when you will use its flash light but in daylight co
i am not going to write about each component individually cause every part of the phone is awesome ( screen , looks etc ) and truly a flagship phone class .
i am only going to write about few components where something is wrong or could be improved .
again mind you i have given it 4 star rating so its a awesome phone , just writing the negatives as they are few compared to positives which are too many .
also i am upgrading from mi 3 . getting hot : its heats up almost to a point of unbearable , speci
all in all good phone , hence would only write cons : 1 . heating issue while charging .
2 . battery issue , 3080 mah should last 1 . 5 days , however barely lasts a day .
3 . very few genuine accessories available right now , need to wait , flipkart should work on this .
hope these things can be fixed with next updates
never received such a low quality product from any online sites so far .
the hardware buttons are so loose and soft .
1 ) battery life : it &apos;s important to note that it &apos;s a lithium ion battery , so the 1 st time you turn on your phone , you should immediately charge it until it is fully charged and then for 6 additional hours .
this will not only increase your battery life , but make sure that the natural decline in battery life over the months is mitigated .
although i agree with many people that theoretically this problem should be absent with li .
batteries , but from a practical standpoint it does matter .

unboxing redmi note 4 . good phone
best mobile but flash sale is not correct
i want to give 3 . 5 star rating there is no doubt this is a good phone .
but front camera quality is very very poor .
this is not for selfie lovers
nice product

values for that price .
need to sale more products .

battery takes more than 3 hrs to charge
superb mobile but little bit expenaive price comparing with 3gb varient then otherwise all is well .
good performance good cameraas good ram management good screen but only defect there is no hd screen resolution only support 7 20 quality .
no hd i , e 1080 quality in this heavy price .
( redmi note 4 also same price that has hd resolution screen ) .
i dissapoint about only in this point .
i hope my review helps u
a good budget deal : phone is good .
touch is fluid .
keypad is hard sometimes .
not a major probs except those who type a lot .
ie watsapp / fb .
call quality is good .
battery life is good too .
camera is just average .
the imp .
thing is phone is pocket friendly .
speaker is really loud .
overall design is compact and stylish .
so overall a good purchase except camera ( in night particularly ) and occassional hardness in keypad while typing .
i found a solution though .
not fully guranteed but its working for me .
if
after checking the phone !
finger print does not work properly
the phone is getting heated during call and battery charging .
thank you flipkart .

what an amazing mobile is this !
it &apos;s just wow and best mobile from mi .
battery 10 / 10display 10 / 10camera 8 / 10sound 9 / 10processor 10 / 10ram 10 / 10looks 10 / 10design 10 / 10you may go blindly for this smaller size mobile if you are not habitual to the tablet size big screen mobile ( which are difficult to handle with one hand and also discharges rapidly than smaller sized phones ) this is also a pocket friendly mobile phone .
worth every penny
this review is based on 5 days experience .
unboxing 1 . handset 2 . charger with usb cable3 . booklet of no use ( in chinese ) otg cable and headset are not available and shouldn &apos;t expect at this price also .
pros .
1 . looks great in hand .
not a boring look like other phones at this price in market .
2 . miui is really smooth3 . sound quality
heat up problem ram management is not that k , apps crashes in middle , it can be fixed in an update , camera is the best in redmi 1 s , no one can beat front camera , i got 3 screen protector with it , started loving my redmi
superb phone full value for money .
still working fully functional .
even working with original battery no battery replaced .
this is why mi is the best of the best mobile phones .
my phone is one of the most newly launched phones .
it is a dec 201 4 model .
hey guys , review of the redmi 1 s , any questions can be asked under our youtube channel &apos; nitty gritty reviews &apos; , where we have posted our review &amp; amp ; we can answer your questions .
build quality quite good .
one of the better handsets at this price range .
the removable back leaves some space in between which makes it feel a bit hollowish dragon trail glass for the front panel is an amazing plus at this price point .
no backlit keyboard .
hard to use in it in the dark .
but this is something
for every one who is complaining about the battery drain follow these steps i used to face a similar battery drain but now my battery lasts for 1 complete day with my 3g always on for browsing , frequent calling and 2 hrs of music .
just follow the following 1 ) calibration process : let ur battery discharge completely , then let your phone charge to 100 % in the switched off mode .
so no switch on your phone which shows 100 % battery and charge for 30 minutes .
thats it your done .
pro &apos;s : 1 ) t
this is to &apos; inform all of you who are painstakingly writing reviews about redemi 1 s only two points to consider before buying this phone 1 ) look at the price you are paying for this phone .
don &apos;t complain about the battery ram and heating problems mark my words don &apos;t expect an iphone in this price .
you get what you pay for remember if you wan &apos;t an excellent experience grab a moto g 2 edi if you can &apos;t spend don &apos;t expect it in 6 k note _ _ this mobile is for normal users only heavy users , gamer
its a decent phone there is minor heating which is normal for a quad core phone pros 1 ) cheap affordable phone2 ) great camera3 ) great display crisp and clear4 ) apps don &apos;t crash if you are not running 20 apps at one time in background listening to music playing games and running wifi as well .
remember its just a 6000 bucks phone if you want it to run like samsung galaxy note you should pay some bucks and buy that .
cons1 ) headphone not included2 ) no free memory card given overall this
first thing first , people who purchased this phone and expect performance and quality comparable to 20k phones will definitely abuse this phone .
if u are like them don &apos;t buy this phone .
i got this phone delivered on 2 5 th sep and so i am writing this mail after a month of constant use .
pros : compare the specs u are getting at this price with same comparable specs in any other brand like nokia , samsung , htc , sony and be assured u need to extend your budget to 1 5 k + .
so it is a true value for
phone is great on papers for price of rupees 6000 but found 2 3 problems after using it a day first , the back cover is not properly aligned to fit on the phone &apos;s body .
whenever you put little pressure on back , the cover makes click sounds near the locks .
as if the cover is not properly locked with the back of phone .
second problem is that video camera is not able to record the voice from rear mic properly as the audio is very low when i tried recoding the video of a person from 3 feets away
when you unbox the set you will say wow in rs 6000 / when you on the phone and see the touch and screen clarity again you will say wow in rs 6000 / but as you start using phone you start saying something missing .
battery life many things missing ram usage many things missing apps crash some thing missing heating problem some thing need to be done no head phones in box even phone of rs 2000 / have one some thing missing .
some call drops and network prob
already told it &apos;s a best set what a package

honest review1 . camera is good for both front and back2 . no heat3. performance slow only , don &apos;t think so 6gb ram act as 2gb ramlack of application issue .
if you insert sd card always after restart it will ask to format .
sometimes its accepting .
same with otg lack of performance issue copying 1gb with in 5 second but after 95 % .
it will take 10 mins to complete .
some time otg is not accepting showing as charging .
this is some software problem .
4 . battery is ok only not excellent .
very good
amazing mobile under 20kvery nyc performance good camera excellent battery thanks to flikart and ekart for fast delivery .
no update available in my device .
awesome device i.e.
camera , processor , body , looking , rom / ram , display , battery .
perfect combination .
first of all thanks to infinix team and flipkart team .
i &apos;m fully satisfied with this mobile .
infinix is hero - not zero * nice mobile under 20k * mobile looks pretty good , 5 . 98 inches full hd display and gold coating is awesome .
best camera quality for both front and rear .
also , flash brightness is excellent .
slightly mobile heating while charging .
no heating issues while playing .
its nt a phone .
first thing first : this phone is not laggy hd gaming : smooth with no frame drops .
multi tasking : you can play three high graphics game simultaneously .
split screen : works perfectly .
ram management : quite good and works more efficiently after the first software update .
camera quality ( f &amp; amp ; r ) : amazing day light photos , low light photography is more than average .
camera features : all features including bokeh effect , portrait mode , auto mode , pro mode and 2x optical zoom work perfectly and .
very good phone with money can purchase .
the only con was it doesn &apos;t have narrow bezel .
no heating .
no battery draining .
very good front and rear cams .
it has pre installed useful apps .
really loved it .
superb beast mobile , no words , super quality
forget all other mobiles at this price point ! got it for 13600 in exchange .
pros : 1 . display is big and too good .
the ppi count is less .
but still i find it excellent .
it has some good features like vivid contrast .
screen looks bright .
small hands have problem using the big screen in one hand .
however there is an option to reduce screen size to 4 or 4 &apos; 7 if you have lot of things to do in one hand .
you have an option to shift to left for left handed .
very small hand might have problem holdi .
best in 9k rangesharing experience after 1 week usefew unnecessary application occupying space , in default .
around 72 uninstalledcamera quality average in this range .
this is the cheapest phone ever .
the camera is better than mi , coolpad , lava , xolo .
battery backup is very good fingerprint is workingwell display is very good .
all the feature is very good at this range than any other phone at this range .
value for money .
i have used this phone almost a month .
so i want to share some of the pros and cons of this phone .
believe me there are no such greater cons which you have to regret after purchase .
pros : 1 . beautiful premium design .
phone looks and feel are way more good than expected in this price range .
phone looks so classy .
2 . full hd screen with 401 ppi density gives better viewing angles and detailed graphics .
in heavy sunlight , there are no issue in using this phone as it has built in outdoor mode .
very very nice phone under 10k .
everything is so good .
especially both cameras and battery life .
fast charging is also good .
all features are good .
expecting more .
flipkart - you are best in offers and trustworthy .
on time .
person was kind .
keep doing the best .
it has too many apps , i think they are trying to establish themselves as a global brand .
people have to accept .
love the home screen , wallpapers , browser .
just used the phone for 24hours .
good smartphone1 . good performance in this price2 . superb front camera3 . excellent battery with fast charging4 . best experience with 5 . 7 inch full hd screen .
got within a day delivery fully satisfied with the service .
i used iphone headset then also not up to the mark .
2 ) very important is the power botton is interrupt every time when u hold the handset .
it &apos;s exactly center at side .
( which i faced issue ) but great handset worth val .
for a full charge - display is crispy and vivid better than my mi note 4 - battery lasts about 1 . 5 days - oreo version 35 is nice - crystal clear sound - strong signal strengthm .
very honest review : i am mi fan .
my whole family has mi phones .
but now i lost interest in mi phones , nothing new , same design , hardware and ever month new launch , wtf .
i bought the poco f1 and returned it .
but now someone takes a note and did actually what i wanted from a very long time .
infinix now releases a actual note phone in a budget price range .
i mean why you name a phone to be a &apos; note phone &apos; ? .
this phone is awesome .
infinix is the new boss .
great phone at this range .
android one is a big plus .
apps run as they should .
xpen is a big big productivity booster .
an amazing phone with stylus at an amazing price .
this one &apos;s for all the productivity enthusiasts out there .
nice writing experience and nice painting experience i fell nice volume out put nice x pen nice camera quality
this is truly note 9 on budget .
also probably note 9 done right - i.e.
if you prefer pure android experience .
the stylus works really well - which is the only real defining factor of this phone .
overall , as a phone , is a good buy .
if you are expecting to play games : this is not the phone .
also the camera on phone is average at best .
update : this phone has just received android 9 update , and is better than ever .
infact , just on the software update perspective i would add an additional 1 / 2 .
this phone works better than expected .
the stylus pressure sensing is just wow , and didnt expect the display to be 60hz that &apos;s awesome ! camera does very well in low light .
i love my new note !
if the samsung sd card does not work , then problem is the file system compatibility .
you need to backup your data , format sd card on your mobile and re-transfer your data .
now this is a great phone .
i guess people are used to seeing more and more cameras clogging their phones .
you should understand what this device is and what it is not .
it is not a gaming phone ( although asphalt 9 works great on this device ) and it is not meant for lovers of p .
mobile is good for value .
ear phones has not given .
overall performance is good .
camera is goodcharging is bad not so high speed .
i love this .
today is the day of fashion so that comfortable for all of us
excellent phone came along with x pen very sleek and elegant in appearance
pros : 1 ) gorgeous red colour .
looks and feels very premium .
5 ) bundled fast charger , screen guard and back tpu cover .
6 ) good network reception and voice clarity .
7 ) good display for the price .
8 ) very good sound output through headphone jack and via bluetooth .
9 ) dual voltecons : major con : box says only 1 free android upgrade which means this phone won &apos;t get any update beyond pie .
simply .

best in this budget .
what a fast delivery .
thank you seller &amp; amp ; flipkart team .
this price best phone
best camera
truly top class design and phenomenal performance .
i have been using it from last 2-3 days and this really beats all other competitors in this segment .
i have shifted to realme from xiaomi and this has been a great choice overall .
realme c2 handles all the daily tasks very efficiently and is even great for multitasking .
one thing is for sure , the optimization and ram management has been done really well and i have fallen in love with this powerful and beautiful beast .
what an amazing device .
the diamond cut pattern looks amazing .
so it gives you perfect grip to hold it .
it will rarely slip from your hand .
the display is gorgeous .
its bright and vibrant .
you will surely be amazed on the first boot itself .
surprisingly the device doesn &apos;t feel heavy though it has massive 4000mah battery .
as usual photos are coming nice and sharp .
in this budget you really can &apos;t complain about it .
color os 6 . 0 is much much better than its pre .
nice phone performance is really good and battery quality owsom and ping playing vary smooth i like it this phone
my honest opinion would that you cannot get anything better than this in this price range .
the back camera and battery performance is totally awesome , screen quality is decent considering the price point and as you all know the design is so beautiful that it totally takes the points away from its competitors .
i definitely give a thumbs up to realme for such great product .
i brought it for my younger brother , as it has all the needed specs in a budget phone and i ordered this for him , he wanted a big performance phone but didn &apos;t have the money and he loved this phone .
it runs all the neccesary things that big phone runs at minimal price , he loves watching movies and web series in this phone .
p .
s - it can run for at least 2 days if you are casual user .
guys , my persoanl advice , gift this to someone who are tight on the budget , you won &apos;t regret it .
awesome realms lovers hit the like button

the first that bugs me is , yes you guessed it right the &quot; user interface &quot; .
the color os brings many good things to the package but it still lacks in many categories and doesn &apos;t appear to be as clean as one ui from samsung .
i will list the pros and cons below and explain them too .

nice cam

1. camera good2 . display better then realme2 ( no brightness issue ) 3. play pubg continuously 4 hours , then some frame lag starts due to 720p display .
4. battery is improve due to powerful p70 processor5. one thing is missing i .

face unlock is comparatively faster than other phones ( personally , i don &apos;t activate it as the phone can also be unlocked using the photo / image ) .
led notification is not available which should have been .
network connectivity is flawless and smooth .
calling and call reception quality is good-speaker output is comparatively lower but better with earphones .

i am writing this review after using this device for 5 days .
3 . option to change the refresh rate to 60hz .
4 . charges 5 % to 100 % in 40 mins .
5 . good build quality .
6 . stereo speaker with dolby support .
7 . good call clarity and signal reception .
8 . 5g support ( but not seen the option to choose 5g on preferred network type ) , hoping it might be due to 5g not available in india .
the best smartphone with an awesome display awesome processor .
front camera is too good .
rear camera can be better as this price point rest everything is fine
except for camera ( which can be fixed in ota updates ) , all the other features are awesome .
super fast charging , super responsive touch screen , good sound quality speakers , fluid display etc .
a very good futuristic mobile for the 2020 .
this mobile is packed with all the latest technologies that exists today .
recommended for those who are looking for a futuristic gadget .
charging time for achieving 100 % is less than 30min .
very nice phone
the phone hardware is very good but the realme ui 1 . 0 needs a lot of policing as the volte is not working for airtel but it works with jio .
after using it for 2 weeks i didn &apos;t find any issue the performance is good .
only concern is volte and wifi calling is not enable currently for airtel .
it is not a good product don &apos;t buy it waste of money on
first impression is very goodbig size notch displayred and black both color is nice .
rear and front camera is also goodbattery backup is awesome .
awesome phone .
must buy .
it &apos;s an amazing mobile phone with least cost
detailed review after using about 10 hrs .
camera is very good captured very good photos from both back and front camera in this price point , so don &apos;t go with negative review .
world best looking phone .

8 mp selfie rock beat 16 mp selfie phone battery 2 . 5 day life
best phone , light weight , better camera and fast processor , long lasting battery
excellent device under such an amazing and satisfying price segment .
it has many good factors .
and many people criticized the phone &apos;s sd 450 processor but , they were wrong .
after about using it around 1 week , i am reviewing about it .
1 ) phone looks stunning , screen quality is good enough .
just , needed to opt out full brightness in outdoors .
2 ) battery is fully great .
even don &apos;t drains usually within 1 and a half day while heavy usage .
3 ) although it comes with huge battery it doesn &apos;t feels bul .
it &apos;s so good , awesome , look , performance , display everything is so so good .
absolute value for money .
a perfect phone in this range
great phone with best features at best price .
i have purchased after many feedbacks from my friends .
three of my friends are using this since september 2018 . all are happy with the performance .
one can go for this phone at this price .
around 13k it &apos;s very good phone to buy .
i play less games , so i don &apos;t know about pubg and others .
battery really lasts at least 1 . 5 day .
camera can more better , but ok .
such a wonderful product for value of money
overall rating is good and excellent
good product and its worth for the prx

best mobile
awesome phone with great battery and outstanding camera .
their is no phone can beat realme c1. in this price .
just go for it .
best in market at this price range
for 16 gb internal storage company must give an option to move app to memory for which one can enjoy with lots of apps smothly .
camera on portrait mode is also a major con of it because u can see lagging issue which frustate you .
conclusion : excluding these two cons this phone is worth for mon .
vary good phone value for money product and performance .
this device is the best device in its price segment .
its specifications are superb .
and its display is just mindblowing .
and also its face unlock is very fast and accurate .
it &apos;s another advantage is its high efficient &apos; sd 450 &apos; processor which runs the device smoothly .
display is something extraordinary to me .
smooth touch response .
design of the device is pretty good and attractive .
everyone bound to fall in love ! * realme c1 &apos;s camera is good , but not the best .
this is acceptable at this .
