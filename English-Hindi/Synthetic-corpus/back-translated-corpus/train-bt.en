the realme 6 and 6 pro models were introduced in india in march and these phones are considered quite good in their price range .
although both of them have become a bit expensive after the gst rate has increased , but they are still quite powerful .
superb design , large screen , powerful processor and 90 hz refresh rate display make these phones stand at the forefront of their segment .
but they say that nothing is ever complete .
there is something missing in everyone and there are some special shortcomings in realme 6 .
if you are thinking of taking this phone , then definitely know them before that .
lcd ips display
realme 6 has a display of 6.5 inch full hd plus 90 hz refresh rate .
in this range , 90 hz display can be said to be a very big thing , but on the other hand , not having a super amoled can be said to be a bit lacking .
at the same time , the phone has gorilla glass coating 3 which is a bit old .
if the new version 6 or gorilla glass 5 were also better , it would have been better .

slow motion video
the main camera of realme 6 is 64 megapixels .
it is a very good feature in terms of price .
at the same time , the picture quality of the phone in day light condition is also very good .
it will not disappoint even in videos with good picture quality .
but if you go towards slow motion video , there will definitely be some shortage .
his feeling was not very good .

pubg hdr + ultra mode
realy 6 has been introduced on the mediatek helia g90t chipset and this chipset has been specially made for gaming .
you will also get a good feel of gaming in reality 6 .
this phone has been introduced with 4 gb , 6 gb and 8 gb ram variants .
but there is a shortcoming with the 4 gb ram model .
this model does not have hdr + ultra mode support with pubg .
this mode is given only with high ram variants .

average selfie
in reality 6 , the company has given a 16-megapixel front camera .
with selfie in the front you have options like portrait and panorama but there is no night mode and you will also get average selfie quality at night .
the kind of selfie we have seen earlier in reality phones is not like that .
notification
by the way , you will feel good about the new reality ui , but in this too , useless notifications bother you .
either you keep an eye on the app as soon as you set up the phone and leave all but a few notifications, or you have to clean the notifications every morning.

see full detail here
in march itself , realme was preparing to launch the new phone narzo but it was stopped due to lockdown but after a long wait of about 2 months , the company has launched it .
the narzo 10 and 10a have been launched in the indian market .
these phones are considered quite good in terms of specification , but it is not that there is no one to challenge them .
xiaomi redmi note 8 model is already available which has the power to give it a tough competition due to the strong specification .
you will also have the same question as to which phone is the best , so let &apos;s make a small comparison so that you too can decide by yourself which phone is the best .
design
the xiaomi redmi note 8 is made of body glass and the company has used corning gorilla glass on both the front and back .
on the side , you will see the mantel .

if you look at the look of realme narzo 10 , you can say that there is a completely new style .
a new type of gradient color has been used which brings newness to the phone .
yes, in one case, it can be said that the glass is not used in the narjo.
the body of the phone is made of polycarbonate plastic .
the screen of xiaomi redmi net 8 is slightly smaller the company has given a 6.3-inch screen .
however , with a small screen , one thing can be said that its screen resolution is fullhd + .
the company has given the eyepiece lcd display which is corning gorilla glass protected .
the aspect ratio of the phone is 19.5 : 9 .
at the same time , you will get to see the big screen in narjo 10 .
the company has used a 6.5-inch screen and comes with an hd + ips lcd display .
the company has used water drop notch and its aspect ratio is 20 : 9 .
gorilla glass coating has been provided to protect the screen .

in this case , you can see that if the screen is bigger in narjo , but the resolution is given in the better redmi note 8 .
processor and ram
the company has introduced xiaomi redmi note 8 with qualco mm snapdragon 665 chipset .
the phone has a 2.0 ghz octa-core processor .
in terms of price , it will be called a very good processor .
at the same time , the company has introduced it with 4 gb ram power and 64 gb storage capacity .
realme narzo 10 has been introduced with the latest processor of mediatek .
this phone works on helio g80 processor and is considered to be a gaming spec .
there is talk of ram , it has only 4 gb of ram but 128 gb of storage .
here you can say that reality looks a little ahead .
although many consider the qualco mm processor to be the best , the snapdragon 665 processor has become a bit outdated .
the helio g80 is new .
in terms of storage too, the rear is heavy.
operating system
both phones work on android operating system 10 but the ui of both distinguishes each other .
while redmi note 8 works on miui 11 , narjo 10 is based on realme ui 1.0 .
there is a good competition in both phones here .
xiaomi redmi note 8 has a quad rear camera setup .
the main camera is 48 megapixels , while the second sensor has been given 8 mp .
this sensor supports wide angle .
at the same time , the third and fourth sensors are of 2 + 2 mp and they are macro and depth sensors .
for selfie , it has a 13-megapixel front camera .
narjo 10 is not far behind .
the quad rear camera setup has also been given in this phone .
the main sensor has been given 48 megapixels .
along with this , there is another 8 megapixel sensor that supports ultra wide angle .
the third sensor is a 2 megapixel macro lens and the fourth is also 2 megapixels but the company has used a mono lens .
a 16mp front camera is available for selfie .
here you cannot call anyone forward or backward , but due to the selfie , rymi looks slightly forward .
xiaomi redmi note 8 has a 4,000 mah battery and comes with an 18 watt fast charger.
while realme narjo 10 has a large battery of 5,000 mah and it also has fast charging of 18 watts .
reality proves to be the best here .
connectivity
both phones have 4g volte support with dual sim .
with this , usb type-c port will be available .
the fingerprint sensor is in the back panel and 3.5 mm audio jack support will also be available .
price
after seeing everything , there is talk about its price and the initial price of xiaomi redmi note 8 is rs 10,999 .
at the same time , realme narjo 10 has been launched for rs 11,999 .
can say that no device is less , but in terms of performance , the redmi note 8 will be called slightly ahead with qualco mm processor .
snapdragon processors are considered slightly stable .
on the other hand , if you are a hard core gamer , then the narjo 10 is the best with a large battery and helio g80 processor .
a few days ago we published a review of the samsung galaxy s20 plus and now we have its big variant galaxy s20 ultra .
since it is a big phone and is more valuable than that , the expectations about this phone are also high .
during the review , we were also testing the phone with this hope .
however , when this phone came into our hands , we were most happy about its camera and zoom features .
because it is the first samsung phone to have a 108-megapixel camera and also the phone has 100x zoom support .
in such a situation , we tried to know whether it is really such a zoom work or has it just been given for the name ? so why not start with the camera .
zoom-zoom-zoom
samsung galaxy s20 ultra has been introduced by the company with a quad rear camera setup .
as we have already said that its main camera is 108-megapixels and it comes with f / 1.8 aperture .
there is wide angle support with this sensor .
apart from this , ois i.e. optical image stabilization feature has been provided with the main camera .
it is also equipped with pdaf which helps in fast focus.
its second sensor is 48 megapixels .
this is a 103 mm telephoto lens that comes with f / 3.5 aperture .
this is the phone &apos;s periscope lens that supports 10x high-optical optical zoom .
along with this , ois , and pdaf support has also been given .
also read : samsung galaxy s20 + review : premium design , great camera and strong performance but slightly expensive
the third sensor comes with f / 2.2 aperture and the company has given a 12-megapixel lens .
this lens supports ultra wide angle .
apart from this , the same lens works in super study video .
to make photography great , a depth vision camera lens with rear camera setup is also present .
there is ai integration with the rear camera .
along with this , modes like panorama , pro mode , live focus live focus video are also given .
here is the matter of slow motion and super slow motion , so far i have not found the best in any phone from samsung .
at the same time , the feature audio zoom taken from the galaxy note 10 has become even better .
that is , you are shooting a video from a distance and when the video is zoomed , the audio will also be zoomed simultaneously .
it will capture the voice even farther and slower than it is clear .

now let &apos;s also mention the camera quality .
according to me , samsung galaxy s20 ultra is one of the most powerful camera phones available in the market so far .
we have already told that it has a zoom feature of 100x .
however , it can be used only during photography and only in normal mode .
zoom does not work during photography at 108 mp .
in the video it is limited to 20x .
we did photography in 100x zoom but the quality was not very impressive but was not less in terms of zoom.
yes , you can definitely say that the huawei p30 pro launched last year is much better than the 60x zoom and can click the workable photo .
the most troublesome during the zoom is that the hand is unable to study .
in such a situation , you will have to use the tripod and the tripod should also be heavy .
because we had a light tripod and had the best handshot .
you can see for yourself that we have seen the super moon in april .
the moon is photographed with a 100x zoom by hand .
the entire moon was not penetrating the screen .
at the same time , you can see the zoom quality up to 30x is best .
also read : samsung galaxy a71 review : this phone is very good but not the best
108-megapixel photography is supported separately and you can turn it on by going to the aspect ratio .
high megapixel photography is really amazing .
no matter how much zoom it bursts .
ultravide angle is provided with the phone .
at the same time , there is an option of 2 x , 5 x and 10 x , 30 x and 100 x for zoom .
you can manually increase yourself for 50 or 60 x in between .
the company has provided optical zoom support of up to 5x , which can be said to be very good .
its night mode is the best and can take a good picture even in low light .
the detailing of the picture taken from the phone is superb and the color combination is also very good .
live focus and live focus video will also impress you .
can not underestimate even for video .
with the samsung galaxy s20 series , the company has started recording video of 8 and its quality is amazing .
even if you look at the big tv screen , there will be no problem .
yes, one thing will say that in video recording, the phone is slightly warm and during 8k it heats up quickly.
the option of 8k recording is provided with the aspect ratio .
at the same time , inside the video settings , there is the option of ordinary hd , full hd and 4k etc .
its flash is also very useful in very low light .
at the same time , its study mode during video recording gives a feeling of gimbal .
yes there is a slight difference of quality in study mode .
overall , it is quite difficult to match its camera .
the thing is that the zoom feature is super up to 10x , best up to 30x and can work in 100x but it becomes difficult to maintain the camera .
performance
the samsung galaxy s20 ultra works on the company &apos;s new processor exynos 910 .
in terms of processor , the galaxy s20 and s20 plus are very similar .
this new samsung processor is quite advanced and is considered equivalent to snapdragon 865 .
along with this , there is mali-g77 mp11 gpu for graphics .
the phone has an octa-core processor that combines 3 processors including a 2 × 2.73 ghz mongoose m5 + 2 × 2.50 ghz cortex-a76 + 4 × 2.0 ghz cortex-a55 .
the thing is that memory is available with 12 gb ram and 128 gb memory .
outside india , samsung galaxy s20 plus ultra is also available in 16 gb ram but only 12 gb ram model is available in india .
however , 12 gb ram memory is also enough and you will not have any problem in this .
about 7 gb ram memory is available for users .
for storage , you will get about 103 gb of space .
the phone has memory card support but it is shared .
that is , you can use either sim card or memory card .
regarding the performance , there is no doubt that this is a great phone and you will not see any problem of hang and lag .
not only the phone &apos;s processor is good , but ram and rom are also available .
however , nttu has just been removed from the play store , so we ran geekbench and managed to score 808 in single core and 2749 on multi-tax .
while the apple iphone was far ahead of it .
but it will not disappoint you .
be it gaming or multitasking , it works better in every respect .
we have never had a complaint of a hang or slowness in 10 days of usage .
but a slight heating problem was also found while playing games or browsing .
it may be corrected after a couple of software updates .
samsung galaxy s20 ultra works on android operating system 10 and in this you get to see samsung &apos;s one ui 2.0 .
in terms of usage , it is very similar to the old samsung phone .
yes ultra is one of the most powerful device of the company , so we were expecting something else but it is not .
you will also find the note app in this samsung phone .
although there is no pen , you can make a creative using fingers .
you will get many options for virtual storage in the phone .
in addition to google drive , one drive integration of microsoft has also been given .
this time another special thing was seen in the app section .
many of the apps are available only with the icon gender and they are in gray color .
until you download them , they will remain gray .
once downloaded , they come in their true colors .
but the drawback is that initially the phone uses about 1 gb of data along with the installation .
apart from microsoft office , onedrive , apps like office outlook have also been taken in samsung galaxy s20 ultra .
at the same time , apps like netflix for video streaming and youtube music for music are also provided .
bixby is given on the power button of the default phone , but you can change that setting if you want .
link to windows app has been given in the phone where you can connect your phone with windows computer with just one click .
apart from this , there is also a dex feature where you can cast your phone on any screen without internet .
connecting via cable, you can use the entire phone from another screen like a desktop.
however there is a slight problem when connecting with the macbook .
despite this , it has a lot of work .
some of the features of galaxy s20 ultra like screen recording , kids mode and focus mode increase its usability .
design and display
although we often start the phone review with the design , but its camera was special , due to which we have mentioned the camera in the beginning .
as for the design , i did not like it very much .
at the same time , the weight of the phone also makes the usage a bit gritty .
although samsung galaxy s20 ultra is made of body glass and built quality is quite premium but good built quality could not improve the design .
the company has introduced it with a large 6.9-inch screen and uses a dynamic amoled 2x capacitive touch screen panel .
the phone &apos;s screen resolution is 1440 x 3200 pixels and its aspect ratio is 20 : 9 .
protection of corning gorilla glass 6 has been given in both its front and back .
the samsung galaxy s20 ultra uses a punch hole display .
although there was a dual punch hole in the s10 plus last year , but this time you will get a single punch .
but the good thing can be said that the punch hole is already quite pierced and will not bother you much on the screen .
the bezels have also gone down significantly .
in the galaxy note 10 plus where both hardware buttons were given in the left panel of the phone .
this time it has come to the right panel .
in the bottom panel of the phone , you will find usb type c port and loudspeaker grill .
the 3.5 mm audio jack has been removed by the company .
usb type-c port works for charging or music .
the earphone is available with a sales pack and its quality is very good .
the phone has a sim slot in the upper panel .
there is a square inside the large rectangle on the back panel of the glass , which is seen when looking a little .
inside the square is a flash with three cameras .
at the same time you will get a voice cancellation mic .
at the bottom there is a periscope camera .
although the company has tried something new in design , but this newness will not be called better than the old one .
maybe you like it but it has some shortcomings which can be called big .
as if the camera is facing upwards from the body .
the design is sleek and the thickness of the phone is only 8.8  mm .
but in the place of the camera , about two  mm and higher rises and it is a very large area , in which the phone becomes very thick .
the company has tried a lot to adjust the big screen to a compact design , but i found it a bit difficult .
its thickness is 76  mm and it looks quite wide without cover .
if you put the cover on it , the width increases .
in such a situation , it is very difficult to walk with the hand .
apparently if you have a glass body , we will cover it .
if we talk about weight , this is a phone of 222 grams .
a good phone is about 180 and 190 grams but it is 30-40 grams more than them and it will be a feeling .
yes the display quality is great .
it is difficult to sustain someone equal to this .
the company has used a 120 hz refresh rate , which is currently available in very few phones .
the performance will look smooth .
however , use this refresh rate only when you are playing the game , otherwise the battery performance is weak .
there is an option to reduce the refresh rate in the display setting .
at the same time , you can also downgrade the screen resolution , it is also very good for battery saving .
overall , the design and display can be said that the superb display quality fades due to weak design .
the samsung galaxy s20 ultra has a large 5,000 mah battery .
the phone has fast charging support of up to 45 watts .
at the same time , wireless charging is also supported and maximum 15 w charging speed will be available in it .
this phone is understandable in charging samsung &apos;s other wireless charging supporting accessories such as earbuds and galaxy watch , as well as charging other phones via cable .
it has reverse charging support .
the battery performance of the phone is good and once fully charged and used continuously with full resolution at 120 hz display gives about 12 hours of rest which can be said to be very good .
if the average is used then one will spend the whole day in comfort .
if you use 60 hz display with low resolution then you don &apos;t have to worry .
will remove one and a half days in normal use .
samsung galaxy s20 ultra has dual hybrid sim support .
the company has introduced the lte version in india while the 5g version is also available outside .
it is different that there is no 5g in india right now , but when someone is investing so much money , 5g will find it so that it is ready for the future .
apart from this , wifi calling , nfc and samsung pay integration will also be available .
music has dolby integration in it .

samsung samsung galaxy s20 ultra was launched in the indian market for rs 92,999 , but now after the gst increase , its price has been increased to rs 97,900 .
in such a situation , the question is whether it is so powerful that about 1 lakh rupees should be paid .
my answer would be if you want to get the phone with the most powerful camera then it is fine .
otherwise it is better to take s20 plus if you want performance , design and good camera .
similarly , if you want to get the most stylish phone , then you can see the galaxy z flip by investing some money .
because that phone is not even less in performance .

today almost a portable speaker is available in every household .
i will not say about how his voice is and how it is not , but i will definitely ask if there is a mic in it so that you too can sing in your voice ? or if you are having a party , then you can dance to the music with all the announcements from it ? no ! then it will say that your bluetooth speaker is lacking .
because a small speaker will fulfill your music needs but cannot fulfill the desire of the song .
there is a singer somewhere in every person , whether he sings good or bad but he definitely wishes .
if you too have a similar hobby , then zoook rocker thunder plus is the best choice .
this is the reason why the company has named it portable entertainment party speaker .
we got this zook speaker for review and we used it for over 1 month .
after that has given its decision .
let us begin the review with a design .
since we have already said that the company has designed it specifically for the party , it is a bit bigger in size .
the length of zoook rocker thunder plus is 51 centimeters i.e. half a meter .
the width and thickness are 23.2 cm and 20 cm respectively .
although it seems very heavy to see , but when you pick it up , you will not feel that much .
it weighs 3.5 kg , which seems very small according to size .
the body of this music system is made of rugged plastic which is not thick black .
in this case , you will feel like a little metal .
built quality is fine but we were hoping for a little better than this .
if you talk about design , then you will enjoy it according to the party .
all the control buttons are provided at the top and there are also connectivity slots .
there are handles on the side which you can lift by holding the device .
these handles make it very easy to take it somewhere .
the design is so good that it does not fall quickly .
overall you will like the design .
after everything was good , if the quality was a little better then it would have been fun .

along with the sales pack , in addition to the music unit , aux cable , charging cable , wireless mic and remote have been given , which can be said to be a good thing .
features
talking about the features of zoook rocker thunder plus speakers , the company has equipped it with both wire and wireless features .
it has bluetooth version 4.2 support for wireless music .
along with this , aux connectivity is also available for wire .
apart from all this , the company has also provided microsd card slot and usb port where you can play store music in the card or pen drive .
as i already mentioned , it has mic support .
the company has supported both wireless and line-in mikes .
apart from this there is also fm radio .
regarding the output , it has a dual speaker and the company has given full range speakers of 6.5 inch + 6.5 inch .
the speaker output is 40 40w pmpo and the company claims superior music quality .
the company has given a 4,000 mah battery which is rechargeable .
at the same time , it supports dc 5 volts for charging .
the music player is capable of providing 4 hours of music play back .
at the same time , the charging time is also 4 hours .
its sound sensitivity is 65dba according to aw ho standard .
however , you can turn it off if you want .
the company has given the option .
at the same time , it has karaoke support , which can be said to be a very good thing .
in terms of connectivity , this music system is capable of pairing with android and ios devices .
after seeing all the features , it comes to the quality , so let me say that connectivity is very good .
we paired it with several devices and it was capable of that .
at the same time , the wireless mic also gets connected just by turning on , you don &apos;t have to try too much .
although the remote is provided , the presence of buttons makes it easier to use .
now let &apos;s talk about the sound , it is good .
since the company made it party-wise .
in such a situation , its texture and light impresses .
but when it comes to music , it will be called average in terms of party .
it is fine till we make a loud sound , but when you do full sound , the sound starts bursting a bit .
at the same time , the base is also fine .
in such a situation , if you are using it , then my advice would be that you do not listen in full sound , but one thing that is very good is that if you are fond of singing , then this music system is very good for you .
during the experiment we used it in a large hall of 3,000 squares fit and mike perfect was working .
the company has talked about four hours of play back time but if you do not use very loud sound then it will give much more power backup .
you will not complain about battery backup .
yes ! there may be a complaint with charging time .
four hours is too much .
the price of this music player in the indian market is rs 4,180 and it is available for sale at major online stores .
overall the question is whether the portable entertainment party speaker speaker is worth buying or not .
so let me tell you that if you see the price then you will like it .
even if the bang is not fit for the party , but it will definitely work to bring color to the party .
with this , if you are taking your songs for hobby or small announcements etc. then it will be called the best .
the design is good , the connectivity is superb , the battery backup will not disappoint and the price is not too high .

there is no doubt that the poco x2 is a great phone in its budget segment .
its specification is a little difficult to match .
in terms of performance or design , the poco x2 is considered a great device .
but it is also important to say one thing that no matter how much better a device is , but when you use it for a long time , then it starts to have flaws or problems .
there are some similar drawbacks with poco x2 as well .
recently , the mysmartprice youtube channel has revealed the same problems of poco x2 and based on the same , we are going to tell you the 7 major shortcomings of poco x2 .
1 big and heavy : poco x2 phone has been introduced by the company with a big screen but it is also quite heavy with it .
the phone has a 6.67-inch screen and also has a 4,500 mah battery .
you would say that it is heavy because of the big screen and big battery , but it is not so .
in the same range , there is a phone like samsung galaxy m31 which comes with a 6,000 mah battery and also has a bigger screen .
despite this , it seems quite light and study .
apart from this , you can remove even more design deficiencies .
this phone is quite wide with heavy .
since there is a glass body , you will definitely put a cover and after that it becomes even wider .
the camera bump is also quite outward .
the quality is quite good but these small flaws in the design may bother you .
also read: just 3 settings will make your android phone fast
2 lcd display : even though this phone has been introduced with a good processor , the company has compromised on small things .
like super amoled display is available in this range or less phones , but in poco x2 you will get lcd display .
you have to compromise a bit with the display .
today , when people are very much liking the dark mode feature , you will not feel real black in it .
its dual punch hole is visible separately at night .
he does not hide from not having a full black screen .
also read : know what are the refresh rate , 90 hz and 120 hz refresh rate display
3 high hz refresh also bothers : poco x2 is the first phone to be launched below 20 thousand with a display of 120 hz .
with this , the company has turned towards the gaming centric user .
but this same quality also becomes a drawback .
it has a mid-segment processor , due to which you can see jerk twice a day .
animation gets stuck and you can get a little upset seeing these things in the new phone .
although the company may fix it later by giving it software updates but there is still problem .
4 heating : talking about gaming , then let me tell you that there was some trouble here too .
if you play the game continuously for 10 to 15 minutes , then this phone heats up to 45 degrees , you can also feel it near the camera .
it is clearly stated in the video that though no problems were found in the performance during that time .
but the phone was heating up .
5 average wide angle mode : the poco x2 has wide angle camera support but the quality of the wide angle camera is extremely mediocre .
in such a situation , you will prefer not to use it .
especially in low light , it gives very simple results .
however , if you remove the wide angle , the camera quality is quite good .
6 dirty notifications : poco has introduced poco ui in x2 and the company says that it will not see ads .
but there are many preloaded ads in the phone which send a lot of notifications .
however , the worst thing that can be said is that there are quite dirty notifications .
in such a situation, if you are shopping for a phone or using the phone, then turn off the notifications of those apps or uninstall the app you don't like.
7 selfie depth sensor without work : dual punch hole has been given in the phone .
it has a second depth sensor with a main sensor .
normal selfie is good but the depth sensor is no use .
one is his quality is good and secondly because of that he occupies a lot of space on the screen .
the company launched the 64 megapixel camera with the samsung galaxy a70s and we the company introduced its upgraded version galaxy a71 .
this phone also came to us for review .
during this time we used it for about 10 days and mainly tried to know two things .
one , how much has this phone upgraded compared to the old model .
on the other hand , if after august , has it become so powerful that it can compete with models like realme x2 pro and oneplus in this range .
so let us start the review by design .
samsung galaxy a71 is quite slick to see and looks quite stylish too .
the body of the phone is in glass finish .
the company previously used the jahn diamond pattern .
at the same time , this time line text has been given , which feels much better .
you will get to see the rear camera in el shape style .
there is no doubt that the design is good but almost the same camera style has been seen in all the recently launched samsung phones .
as far as we are concerned , we liked the earlier camera pattern better .
but over all , when you see the design , it impresses a lot .
the right panel has a volume rocker and power button .
there is a sim slot on the left side and a microsd card option with two sims in the same slot .
the design is good , you will also like it , but if the company had given glass in this budget , it would have been called much better .
at the same time , waterproof feature has been given by samsung in the budget of 30 thousand rupees , in such a situation , we were also expecting it .
the samsung galaxy a71 has a 6.7-inch super amoled screen .
the company has introduced it with a punch hole display , named infinity o.
the aspect ratio of the phone is 20 : 9 and its screen resolution is 1080 x 2400 pixels .
corning gorilla glass 3 is protected on the phone , the company has used 2.5d curved glass .
also read : samsung galaxy tab s6 lte review : smart and creative but slightly expensive
the display of the phone is superb and it also meets the way you expect from a samsung phone .
but to remove the deficiency , it can be said that it would have been better if it had a display of 2 .
yes , the real drawback is that gorilla glass 3 is the old protection .
in such a situation , at least there was hope for gorilla glass 5 or 6 .
because you cannot underestimate this price .
also read : samsung galaxy m10s : this smartphone looks expensive than its price
the samsung galaxy a71 has a larger screen .
despite this , you can easily carry it in your hand .
you will not feel overweight .
but you cannot use the entire screen with one hand .
will have to put both hands
video and gaming will feel much better in a big and stunning screen .
at the same time , it can be said that it has an indisplay fingerprint scanner , which i cannot say very fast but has become much better than before .
the hardware
the samsung galaxy a71 is almost the same as its old phone in the specification , but the company has definitely upgraded the processor .
this phone works on a qualco mm snapdragon 730 chipset with 8 nanometer fabrication and you will get to see the octacore processor ( 2 × 2.2 ghz cryo 470 gold and 6 × 1.8 ghz cryo 470 silver ) .
overall , when you measure performance , it is fantastic .
even the graphics have become much better .
you can run any game and app in it , there will be no problem of any kind .
at the same time , 8 gb of ram memory increases its strength even more .
out of 8 gb , about 3 gb memory goes into the system file and about 5 gb is received for the user .
talking about storage , there is also about 105 gb free .
the 23 gb system goes into the file .
the phone has expandable memory support and you can use cards up to 512 gb .
there is no doubt that it is great in terms of performance , but if phones like reality x2 pro are available in this budget , then it has the power to give it a tough competition .
the a71 also has a camera upgrade with the processor compared to the samsung galaxy a70s .
although earlier the primary camera was 64 megapixels but there were only three sensors whereas this time you will get 4 sensors .
the main sensor of the phone is 64 megapixels , which comes with f / 1.8 aperture .
at the same time , the second sensor is 12 mp and it comes with f / 2.2 , aperture .
this sensor supports ultra-wide angle .
similarly , the third sensor is of 5 mp and it comes with f / 2.4 aperture .
this sensor is given for macro short .
the fourth sensor is also 5 mp and it comes with f / 2.2 aperture .
this sensor performs the function of depth sensing .
the picture quality of all over phones is superb .
even if not the best , it is second to none in this range .
does very good photography in normal mode .
at the same time it is difficult to get wide angle equal to samsung .
the bokeh effect is also much better .
night mode is good but we were hoping for better .
if you talk about video , then you will not get any complaint there .
this phone has eis support which makes the stabilization slightly better .
at the same time , a video record of 4 is also given .
all these things are also found in other phones .
but we found the ultra-slow video of the most special samsung galaxy a71 .
in slow motion , samsung still cannot match other brands in this range .
overall you will be satisfied with the camera segment .
the phone has a 32 mp front camera for selfie .
if you compare it to the a70s , the quality has already been good despite the same megapixels but still got some more exposure .
software
the samsung galaxy a71 has been introduced on the android operating system 10 .
this phone works on one ui 2.0 .
although there is not much newness in the os .
big and clean icons make the use of this phone easy .
earlier , samsung used to see a lot of preloaded apps .
at the same time , this time has been reduced considerably .
although apps like facebook and netflix have been given in the phone .
at the same time , many other samsung apps including bixby voice and bixby vision will be found .
the os is new and will receive updates even further .
it will get options like kid mode , smart view and link to windows where you can connect your phone to the desktop wirelessly with one click .
dual 4g has been given in this dual sim based phone .
apart from wifi and bluetooth , there is also nfc support .
you can use samsung pay etc. comfortably .
the company has also provided features such as always always on display and qr scanner .
वहीं म ् यूजिक के लिए आपको डॉल ् बी एटमॉस इंटीग ् रेशन मिलेगा ।
for power backup , this phone has a 4500 mah battery .
the company has given 25 watt fast charging with it .
in less than an hour and a half , this phone gets charged properly .
it does not have wireless charging support .
samsung galaxy a71 has only one memory variant in the indian market and is priced at rs 29,999 .
the look performance and battery backup of the phone is good but in this budget , models like the riyami x2 pro and oneplus 7t give it a tough competition .
in the case of processing , they go beyond this .
yes , it is definitely ahead in the camera .
in such a situation , it can be said that if you want to take a samsung brand phone with better camera , then it is good , otherwise other options are also available .
last year , in 2019 , for the first time in the samsung galaxy s10 series , the company introduced 3 models in which one model was of the galaxy s10e .
this was the lowest priced model that people were considering as the economic version of the galaxy s10 series .
at the same time , for 2020 , people were hoping that something similar would happen in the galaxy s11 .
but about a month before the launch , it was revealed through a leak that this time it is not only the galaxy s11 but the company is going to launch the galaxy s20 series by taking the number 10 leap together .
yes , in february the company introduced three models simultaneously in the samsung galaxy s20 series .
the galaxy s20 plus and galaxy s20 ultra were launched along with the samsung galaxy s20 and we have the s20 plus model available for review .
in detail about what we experienced during the use of about 10 days .
let &apos;s start with the design .
samsung has been using glass in the galaxy s series for the last several years and this time it is something similar .
this phone is built on a metal frame and you will see glass in the front and back .
it is curved on both sides , so it feels very comfortable to hold .
the matter of build quality is fantastic .
this phone will make you feel of premium quality.
this phone has been introduced in aura blue , coskim gray and cloud pink color , which looks quite beautiful .
however before that i was using samsung galaxy note 10 plus and in the case of colors , i liked that phone more .
yes ! one thing that can be said well in this is that the fingerprints in the previous panel are quite low .
talking about the port placement of the device , on the right side you will find the volume rocker and power button while the top has a sim slot .
the lower panel has a usb type-c port and a loudspeaker grill .
in the rear panel , the camera sensor , flash light and voice cancellation button will be found in a square-shaped box .
overall , in terms of the look , the samsung galaxy s20 plus is very stylish to look at and despite having a large screen , the design is so good that it easily falls into the palm .
the weight is only 186 grams with slick design .
in such a situation it feels very good .
if you carry it in your hand or pocket , you will not feel heavy .

kami can say that there is a silicone cover with self pack which i do not like at all .
because if you take a premium quality phone and spend a good budget on it , then you also hope for better accessories .
the samsung galaxy s20 plus has a 6.7-inch screen and the company has equipped it with a lot of advanced technology .
the phone has used dynamic amoled 2x capacitive touch screen .
the phone &apos;s screen resolution is 1440 x 3200 pixels and it has been introduced with a 20 : 9 aspect ratio .
in the middle of the screen you will get to see the punch-hole display as we saw earlier in the note 10 .
it has been named infinity o display by samsung .
another good thing that can be said here is that the punch-hole display has become even smaller than before .
the biggest change in the display this time is that the company has used a 120 hz refresh rate and due to this the phone has become even smoother .
at the same time , the screen is hdr 10 plus certified , in such a situation it will give you a great experience .
screen protection has a gorilla glass 6 coating on both the front and back .
apart from the adaptive brightness with the screen , you get features such as screen mode , bluelight filter and resolution control .
during the review , we rarely used it on qhd .
at the same time , even in normal use , if the refresh rate is kept at 60 hz then only the consumption of the battery is reduced .
after knowing everything , one thing has to be said is that samsung was the best in display even before and no one can match it even today .
the display quality is excellent and the touch response is superb .
samsung galaxy s20 plus has been introduced by the company on the exynos 910 chipset .
although a model with qualco mm snapdragon 865 chipset is also available in some countries , but in india , the company has brought exynos based phones .
along with this , the mali-g77 mp11 gpu has been given .
for processing , it has an octa-core processor that comes with a 2 × 2.73 ghz mongoose m5 + 2 × 2.50 ghz cortex-a76 + 4 × 2.0 ghz cortex-a55 processor .
the phone is available with 8 gb ram and 128 gb memory .
the phone has a hybrid slot where in the second slot you can use a sim card or microsd card .
the phone has up to 512 gb card support .
the company has equipped the storage with ufs 3.0 technology .
that is , introduced with ultra fast 3.0 technology which stores faster data than before .
however before samsung we have seen this technology in oneplus and xiaomi .
as far as performance is concerned , there is no doubt that it is very impressive but it cannot be called the fastest .
on the nttoo score and benchmark it falls slightly behind apple .
at the same time , the ui of samsung is a bit slow .
however , it is not that you will have a hang problem or the phone gets stuck somewhere .
rather the app takes a little time while opening an open or heavy game .
yes , one thing will definitely say that after 120 hz refresh rate screen , it seems smooth enough .
although the 108-megapixel camera sensor has been manufactured by samsung itself , it was not used in samsung phones till now .
it is introduced for the first time in the galaxy s20 ultra .
at the same time , talking about samsung galaxy s20 , the company has introduced the s series phones for the first time with a 64 mp camera .
earlier , galaxy had launched in a70s and a71 .
but here , let me tell you one thing that the main camera of samsung galaxy s20 plus is not 64 megapixels .
this quad camera setup is provided .
the main sensor is of 12 mp with f / 1.8 aperture .
it has wide angle support .
along with this , dual pixels , pdaf and ois support have also been provided .
the second sensor is of 64 mp and it comes with f / 2.0 aperture .
in this also you will get pdaf , ois support .
in addition , up to 3x high optical zoom has been given .
the third sensor is of 12 mp and it comes with f f / 2.2 aperture .
it is an ultraviolet lens and has super steady video support .
along with this , the fourth sensor is of vga resolution , which acts as a tos 3d sensor and this depth sensing .
the phone will also get a live focus video feature with live focus photos , which we saw for the first time in note 10 .
along with this , audio zoom has also come from note 10 .
if we talk about zoom , then let me say that this phone supports digital zoom up to 30x .
although the zoom up to 5x is still correct and to a lesser extent you will be able to use 10x as well , but 30x becomes quite pixelated .
some success may be achieved when used on a tripod in day light condition .
that is , it will click this slightly better photo with 30x zoom .
as far as normal photos are concerned , it will not disappoint there .
this phone also has the power to give a good competition to the iphone 11 .
even in low light it will not be called less than anyone .
even in utter darkness , it clicks a good image .
at the same time , the use of flash in dark condition is also very helpful .
if you compare it with samsung galaxy s10 or note 10 series then the camera has been upgraded significantly .
quality has become much better than before .
changes will be seen everywhere , whether it is wide angle or blur effect .
however , the most upgrade has happened in the video segment .
the video study mode is quite impressive .
although the quality is a bit dull , but the shoot feels exactly like gimbal .
apart from this , live video and wide angle video also makes it stand out further than other phones .
this time a single take mode has been given which produces a collage of video and image .
this is a new feature which is quite impressive .
overall , the camera segment has become quite strong and challenges any flagship phone .
this phone works on android operating system 10 and samsung's one ui 2.0 will be seen.
in some phones including the note 10 plus , we used oneui 2.0 in the past , so there was not much newness .
yes , some good options like screen recorder and music share have come this time , which users have been demanding for a long time .
especially screen recorders .
at the same time , apart from the kids mode in the phone , there is also focus mode where if you are studying or doing something special , then it will turn off all apps and notifications so that your focus does not get disturbed again and again .
the notification of only those apps will come .
it has microsoft windows apps pre-loaded and you can connect to it with a single click .
along with this , apps like netflix and youtube music are preloaded .
it does not have aspen but note feature will be available and you can draw anything with your finger .
apart from this , handwriting recognition is also supported .
this phone has dual sim support and you can take advantage of 4g on both .
although it also has a 5g model outside but the company has not launched it in india .
in addition to wi-fi and bluetooth , nfc has also been provided in it , which is useful not only in payment but also in charging accessories .
apart from this you will get usb type-c port but there is no 3.5 mm audio jack .
however , type-c earphones are available with the sales pack , which can be said to be a good thing .
the security thing is the in-display fingerprint scanner .
but you can say that this time is not too fast .
there is one thing in the beginning it seems very slow but as you use it gradually becomes a little faster .
waterproof
like samsung &apos;s other flagship phones , the galaxy s20 plus is also ip68 certified .
that is , it can remain in one and a half meters of water for 30 minutes .
we also did a water test and got it right .
at the same time it could be said that this video was also playing under water .
apart from this , there is dustproof .
for music, this phone comes with dolby integration and apart from earphones, you can also feel it on loudspeaker.
for power backup , the samsung galaxy s20 plus has a 4500 mah battery .
it supports fast charging up to 45 w.
however , the company has given a 25 w charger with a sales pack .
it takes a little over an hour to fully charge with the charger provided with the sales pack .
talking about battery backup , with full hd resolution and at 60 refresh rate , after a good use , it takes out a day comfortably .
this phone lasted 14.5 hours in pc mark .
which can be said to be a good thing .
yes if you use it at 120 refresh rate then it becomes difficult to take a full day .
after testing the phone , it comes to the conclusion that it can be said that samsung has strengthened its flagship series with the galaxy s20 plus .
it has become much better in terms of design , display , performance , especially camera .
at the same time , battery backup has also become better than ever .
yes , when you talk about the price a little bit on the pocket .
this phone is available in the indian market for rs 73,999 and after seeing everything , it will be said that it is a bit expensive .
yes ! this much will definitely say that if you are thinking about buying iphone 11 , then it is definitely necessary to see this phone .
in many cases it proves to be much better than that .

today , as soon as the name of mobile game comes , people first talk about pubg .
but in recent times it has been seen that call of duty has also become very popular .
the game was first launched for pc in 2003 but recently its mobile version has also been launched and people are also liking it .
many people question who is better in both pubg and call of duty games ? to overcome these confusions of mobile users , i have made a small comparison in which you can know who is better .
here both are equal
pubg and call of duty are two different mobile games but both also have many similarities .
the story lines of both games are similar .
both these games are based on the battle royall theme and the way of playing is the same .
in this , the battle ground or maps are the same and you have to kill your enemies .
the controls are there and can be played online .
it is a multi-player game and both have the same job of finding and killing .
the graphics are also almost identical and the weapons are also almost identical .
despite these similarities , there are many differences between the two games , while pubg is better and call of duty somewhere .
here is call of duty . funny
5 vs 5 death : call of duty &apos;s 5 vs 5 death mode is quite good .
pubg does not have this feature and most people prefer call of duty because of this mode .
it consists of two groups of people playing an online game consisting of 5-5 people and then killing enemies .
the group that kills the first 50 people would be the winner .
in order to meet this target , indiscriminate firing and fierce fighting takes place .
it is a lot of fun .
also read : mi smart water purifier ( ro + uv ) review : even better and better
advance mode : advance mode also puts call of duty ahead of pubg .
in this mode you will get a drone to attack enemies and you can also do air strikes .
it sounds like a lot of fun .
we miss these things in pubg .
file size : there is no doubt that pubg is the most popular game today , but you cannot deny that the large file size is its problem .
pubg is about two and a half gb .
at the same time , call of duty comes in half its storage .
that is , there is a file of about 1 gb .
quick action : call of duty is also being liked for this because it is a bit faster than the match .
that is , if you shoot or have any action , then in this game you will see faster , while pubg seems a bit slow .
also read : xiaomi redmi 8 or motorola one macro , read the specifications and tell which phone will sell more ?
in these cases , pubg falls ,
all weapons will be heavy : in some cases , call of duty is ahead but it is not that there is no more left in pubg .
rather , there are many such things in pubg that users love .
the first of these is that you will have all the guns from the beginning .
you will get the weapon you would like to use .
whereas call of duty will get new weapons as the mode is unlocked .
big player base : pubg mobile &apos;s player base is much larger than call of duty , so you get to play with different experts and it becomes quite fun .
maps update : maps are updated very frequently in pubg mobile games .
in such a situation , you will get a lot of newness in it .
call of duty is far behind in this case .
variety : another feature of pubg is that often you will be served different things which makes it even more fun .
for example , if a hollywood movie is being launched , a big character or a big event , then you will get things related to it in the game .
graphics : although the graphics of both the games have been created the same , but in some cases pubg proves to be better than call of duty .
even though there are a lot of companies for tv in the market today , but when the name of tv still comes , first thing is about lg and samsung .
because in terms of display , no one is better than them and even today they are ahead .
with a similar display , lg has launched its new c9 oled tv in india .
in the indian market , this tv is available with 55 inch , 65 inch and 77 inch screens .
we have a 65-inch lg c9 oled65c9 model available which costs around rs 2,35,000 .
although looking at the price , you can say that it is very high but after knowing its features , you probably will not say so .
so let me tell you the reason for this in our review .
we saw xiaomi &apos;s me tv which was quite slim .
but if you see lg c9 oled65c9 , then you cannot live without saying wow .
when we set it in our office , everyone said the same thing on the first look .
age &apos;s more sleek than me tv .
although its thickness is 3.9  mm but it seems a bit thick in the middle , otherwise the corner is even half that of a 7  mm phone .
the rear panel will give you a feel of the mantle that the company has introduced in the brush finish .
earlier , we had also seen oneplus and xiaomi tv , but such quality was not found in anyone .
there are tv ports on the back .
you will also see a stand there .
the stand extends a little away from the tv and there is also a place to remove cable from it so that it does not spread around the tv .
at the same time , the stand has been made very heavy by the company , so that when you place it somewhere , it does not move .
we liked it very much .
because we tried to shake such a big 65-inch tv with some power and it stood .
in such a situation , i can say that if you place it on a table or flat surface , it will not fall .
if you want to mount a wall , that is also given .
connecting ports on the tv will meet on the right .
when you turn to the front after the back , you will get more relaxed .
nothing will be visible other than the screen .
when you give power to the tv , a light comes on below .
at the same time , when you turn it on , then that light also turns off .
in such a situation , you will not get any distraction from anywhere .
overall it is very good in terms of design and the quality is as good .

lg c9 oled65c9 is clear from the name itself that the company has used oled panel .
in terms of display , these panels are said to be quite spectacular and you will be able to realize it yourself .
the company has made it a bezel lace .
the most important thing that can be said is that if you have not played any program in tv , then it plays some scenes by itself and those scenes are so cute that some days of the beginning , you should remove them .
if you have wall mounted , then it will continue to enhance the beauty of your wall .
also read : samsung galaxy note 10 + vs apple iphone 11 , see how much is there
for display , it supports 4k hd ( 3,840 x 2,160 ) resolution and has a wide view angle .
if you look from any corner you will get a clear view .
the advantage of this is that even a little depth effect gets better .
at the same time , it has hdr and hdr 10 support .
you will also realize this while watching tv .
apart from this there is also dolby vision support which makes things more real .
during the review , we played 4k hdr video and the feeling was amazing .
if you look from a normal distance of 10 feet , then you feel as if everything is happening in front of you .
you will not even experience watching tv .
it has options for brightness and sharpness , but the display is so enhanced that we did not need to tamper with it much .
lg is praised for the display and design .
the lg c9 oled65c9 uses the company &apos;s own α9 generation 2 picture processor .
the company claims that it supports 4-step voice reduction and enhances the image on its own .
at the same time , you will also like to know that it supports 120 hz refresh rate .
in such a situation , you will not see frame rate drop or lag anywhere .
quite a smooth video plays .
apart from this , dolby surround and tds decoder have also been provided .
overall we can say that all the advances are equipped with technology .
today the craze of gaming is very much .
the company has taken care of this as well .
people also use big screens for gaming .
in this case , the company has given virtual 5.1 channel surround sound in this tv .
apart from this there are hdmi ports which are capable of giving you 1 millisecond response time .
overall , you will not find disappointment here either .
lg uses web os in its tv and this service is said to be the best for video streams .
something similar here .
you will get a lot of stream service with easy user interface .
where in other android tvs , apps come on the entire screen , there will be a bar at the bottom where all the apps come .
if you want , you can edit it as per your choice .
apps like netflix , hot star , alt balaji , amazon prime video and youtube are already built in with tv .
at the same time , you can download some apps from the company &apos;s store .
although you will get less app than android tv for this , the most important thing of lg c9 oled65c9 can be said that it also supports amazon alexa with google home and the tv has inbuilt .
however , you will not get any home assistant with tv , you will have to take it separately .
the good thing that we liked is that you can control it with voice too and the remote itself has voice support .
as we have already told that its processor is ai capable , when you watch tv , it will promote your favorite things on its own .
you can connect the tv to the android device , in addition there is air play 2 support where you can connect the tv from the apple phone and operate from it .
remote
even today , xiaomi and oneplus have shown remote without buttons , but still people are not comfortable with it .
the lg c9 is the remote of the oled65c9 that the company uses for its nanocell tvs .
you will see a lot of buttons in it but it is very fast .
if you have not used this type of remote already , then there is a problem in the beginning but you become used to it .
it has a scroller with navigation buttons to improve usage .
apart from the simple alphanumeric and guide buttons , netflix and amazon prime buttons will also be available .
in tv you do not get the option of setting quickly but it is given on the remote and you can access it easily .
in the connecting port
tv , you will find four hdmi ports , 3 usb ports , lan , optical port and audio av in and out ports .
the tv has a home dashboard where you can access all connected smart devices .
after seeing all the features and specifications of lg c9 oled65c9 , you can say that it is great .
you may not have seen such a design before .
at the same time , you will not see any deficiency in performance .
the display is amazing .
tvs like oneplus and xiaomi fade ahead of it .
the only drawback to this is price .
2,35,000 seems expensive in the budget of rs .
xiaomi came into the hands of people through mobile phones and went from home to bed room by launching smart bulbs and air purifiers .
now the company has tried to make a place in your kitchen by launching mi smart water purifier ( ro + uv ) .
although mi ro was already available in china , but xiaomi &apos;s india head manu kumar jain had told in an interview with 91 mobiles some time back that &quot; we are assessing its launch in india . &quot;
because in china it comes with no storage and in india storage is necessary .
in such a situation , once the design of the product is final , then we will bring it . ” and something similar happened .
the mi smart water purifier ( ro + uv ) has been introduced in india with 7 liters of storage .
with the launch , this ro was also available to us for review and after about one month of use , we wrote a review that is in front of you .
compact design
when you shop for a home appliance , you first have to worry about the look , size and color of which size , whether it will come with the color of the house or not ? many similar things happen .
but with mi smart water purifier ( ro + uv ) , you will not have any such concern .
the first reason for this is that it is available in only one size and one color .
in such a situation , if you are planning to take it , then at the moment you do not have the option of color and size .
the other reason is that even though there is one color and same size , it adjusts easily at any place and the off white color is set anywhere .

you can easily keep it anywhere in your kitchen or you can volmount if you want .
talking about its size , it is 52.3  mm tall ie less than two feet high .
there is a width of about one foot and a thickness of half a foot .
at the same time it weighs only 6.7 kg with filters .
there will be two touch buttons in the front of the body , they will be used only while connecting the device .
there will be an outer tap to take water below .
the most important thing can be said that where the second ro has storage below and filters above .
at the same time , it has filters under the tap and storage above .
the candles are under a cover that you can remove from the back .
overall , we have no complaints in terms of design and can be said to be different from all the ros available in india .
it is very gentle and beautiful to see , which can be called sober in english .
improved specification
mi smart water purifier ( ro + uv ) uses 3 candles .
it has the first candle ppc filter which comes with polypropylene cotton + activated carbon .
it eliminates harmful elements apart from large particles of water .
the second candle is ro filter ie reverse osmosis filter which eliminates heavy mantle , bacteria and viruses .
the third candle is of pac filter which comes with post activated carbon filter .
if there is any smell or different type of test in the water , it destroys and sweetens it .
apart from this , when the water is stored , there is uv light which removes the bacteria hidden in the water by 99.99 percent from the sterilization process .
this process takes up to 25 minutes every four hours .
this is how the whole process works .

smart features the
mi smart water purifier ( ro + uv ) has wi-fi support and you can connect it to your phone .
for this , you have to download the xiaomi home app in your phone .
however , before the setup , let me tell that the home wifi is on and both mobile and ro are connected to the same wi-fi .
now when you have downloaded the app , turn on the app and go to my devices .
here , you will see the option of mi smart water purifier when you do a kitchen device .

the device will be connected to the phone with blue light in a short time .

along with this , you will also have the information to change the cadre of the filters .
the connectivity of the app is quite easy and you also get notifications according to the need .

does not auto connect .
आसान इंस ् टॉलेशन
although the company &apos;s engineers come for installation for the first time , but if you have a little knowledge , then you can connect it yourself .
in and out is clearly marked for water connections .
at the same time it is easier to place and change candles .
just hold the candle and lift it a little and roll it out .
during the launch itself , the company had informed that to change the filters , you do not need to call the company &apos;s service center and call the engineers .
you can also do it yourself and it &apos;s really easy .
all the things required for installation are already available with the box . you do not need to purchase anything separately .
mi smart water purifier ( ro + uv ) is priced at rs 11,999 .
this is a good option in this price range .
it is very stylish to look at and also very easy to use .
however the main job is to filter water and there it meets its job .
we also filtered 1800 tds water during use and were able to bring it down to 130 – 150 .
it clears the water fairly fast and mobile connectivity is also good .
we did not need an engineer to place the candle , we had connected ourselves , but still when the company engineers came , they investigated well .
during the investigation we found that if the flow of water is good then it cleans 7 liters of water in 45-50 minutes .
yes , it can be said about the water test that its test was slightly different from the ro already available at home .
the reason for this may be mineral content which was in our old ro .
yes the test was not bad but quite good .
regarding the matter of cost , yes , it would definitely be said that with this specification , branded ros are going to be bought in a budget of rs 12 – 15 thousand .
while engineers may not have to be called , but the service cost is not low .
the cost of changing the filter is almost the same or slightly more .
because the price of its ppc filter will be rs 1,299 , the cost of ro filter will be rs 1,799 and for pac filter , rs 899 .
if you change them even once a year , then you will have to pay a fee of rs 3,997 , which is not less .
if you want to see other stylish ros in this budget , then apart from blue star edge and blue star prisma , many other options are available including livpure pep plus and aquaguard enhance .

when the first galaxy note phone was launched by samsung in the year 2011 , there were many talks about this phone .
when someone praised it , someone was unhappy with this big 5-inch phone .
incidentally i also got a chance to review that note and i was going to the metro with the phone .
this device was in my pocket .
at that time there were no such big devices .
in such a situation , during security checking , i was asked to remove the phone from the pocket .
as soon as i pulled out the phone , the security personnel there said , &quot; you are walking around with a tv in your pocket &quot; and we started laughing out loud .
although people were laughing at the time of seeing the size of the note , but later that same phone became trend and today only big screen phone is in trend .
yes ! it is also necessary to say here that even though other phone manufacturers have matched the screen , the note is still only with samsung , which has given the best spen .
with these same features of spen , samsung galaxy note 10 and galaxy note 10 + launched in india .
in the last ten editions , not only the style of the note has changed but the spen has also become quite advanced .
we have the galaxy note 10 + available for review and after looking at the phone we can say that this time we have a lot to tell .
if we leave the galaxy note 7 , then we have reviewed all the available notes before and this phone is the most different , not only in design but also in features .
so let &apos;s start the review of samsung galaxy note 10 + .

samsung galaxy note 10 + and note 10 + with sharp photo and stylish look
let me first tell you that the samsung galaxy note 10 and note 10 plus have a difference of screen resolution , battery , camera and memory along with the screen size .
in terms of design , both phones are similar and both have the same processor .
the samsung galaxy note 10 plus is a little advanced .
let &apos;s start with the design of the review .
if you take the premium design
samsung galaxy note 10 + , it will make you feel premiumness .
the built quality of the phone is superb and it is also very attractive to watch .
this phone made on metal frame is of glass and can be said that it is a bit delicate .
that is , if you are using it without cover then there will always be a fear of breaking .
yes , if you compare it to the note 9 , it has become a bit bigger and wider .
the note 9 has a length and width of 161.9 x 76.4  mm while the note 10 plus is of 162.3 x 77.2  mm .
at the same time , the new phone has become slightly slick while the battery is big .
the thickness of the galaxy note 9 is 8.8  mm while the thickness of the note 10 plus is only 7.9  mm .
for this , the company is praised that it has become slim even after the big battery .
in the rear panel , the corners are quite smooth with curves , so they do not prick and you can move around with your hands for a long time .
another thing we liked about the design is that it does not slip quickly by hand .
samsung galaxy note 10 + has been introduced in four colors including aura glow , aura white , aura black and aura blue .
the phone is quite bright .
the back panel is so shiny that you can also use it to see your face .

design has seen a big change this time .
earlier in samsung phones where the power buttons were on the right side , this time with the power button on the left side .
although initially we had some difficulty in making it count in habit , but after a couple of days , everything went well .
at the same time , the power button of the note 10 can also be customized .
you can setup the camera with a single click in the power button .
wake bixby or power off can be set up on long press .
if you have setup bixby wakeup then you have to press both volume and power buttons simultaneously .
apart from this , a change has been made in the design .
this time there is no 3.5 mm audio jack .
there is a usb type c earphone with a sales pack , but we often felt the need for a 3.5 mm audio jack during use .
the bottom panel itself has a loudspeaker and aspen with a usb port .
in the upper panel , you will find a sim slot .
ultimately, the same can be said about the design that it is very stylish to look at and if you take it in hand, you will also realize that it is an expensive phone.
yes ! the lack of an audio jack is often missed .
since the phone is of glass , there is a fear of breaking it , but silicon cover has been given with the sales pack , this can be said to be a good thing .
but we also suffered a bit from this .
in an expensive phone , we were hoping for a better quality cover .
the covers are simple .
like the previous note phones , the samsung galaxy note 10 + is also ip 68 certified .
that is , this phone can stay in 1.5 meters of water for 30 minutes and will not be damaged .
smart display
the samsung galaxy note 10 + plus is quite impressive in terms of design as well as display .
the phone has a 6.8-inch screen and in it you will see a punch hole display named infinity o by samsung .
the company first introduced the galaxy s10 series in india with infiniti o.
however there is a difference here .
in the s10 series where the punch hole was at the top right of the screen .
at the same time , it has been given in the middle of the display .
the edges are very low and nothing will be seen except the screen in the front .
the company has used dynamic amoled display panel which is curved on both sides .
the screen resolution of this phone , presented with a 19 : 9 aspect ratio , is 3040 × 1440 pixels .
it is hdr10 + certified with 522 pixels density .
overall , it can be said that you will not get such a display feeling anywhere else .
also read : samsung galaxy note 10 + vs apple iphone 11 , see how much is there in the
company has introduced it with these display fingerprint scanners .
earlier we used these display fingerprint scanner in samsung galaxy s10 and in note 10 it has become more fast and accurate .
however , these displays of oneplus are still slightly behind the fingerprint scanner .
spen is the biggest power of the
magic pen samsung galaxy note series and this time it seems as if the company has made spen a magic wand .
this time , many new gesture features have been given with aspen which are quite impressive .
for the last two years , the tip-top aspen is being provided with the note , the third year also the company has given a similar pen .
although there is no feature on the tiptop , but now in the new pen , you will be able to remotely control the camera to a great extent .
since last year , the note was equipped with bluetooth and the company added a remote feature to it .
जहां आप पेन को प ् रेस कर कैमरा ऑन कर सकते थे , रियर से सेल ् फी और सेल ् फी से रियर कैमरे को बदल सकते थे और पिक ् चर क ् लिक कर सकते थे ।
all these features are still there .
but now in the new features , after turning on the camera , when you press the side button in the pen and press it from right to left or from left to right , the camera feature changes .
you can remotely access almost all the features including video from camera mode and live focus from video .
not only this , if you rotate left to right while pressing the aspen button , the camera zoom in and similarly if you rotate from left to right , the zoom will be out .
the samsung galaxy note 10 plus &apos;s spen also works better in youtube , in addition to play pouzas , you can change videos with gestures .
you will be surprised to know that the aspen is capable of working from a distance of about 30 feet .
we used it several times keeping the phone far away and each time it was working correctly .
aspen has been made so well that you will be happy to hear its merits .
even if two aspen come together , the other one will not work with your phone .
\
yes ! if you put it in your phone , then it gets registered with your phone .
once the aspen is registered , then it will work .
the shortcoming can be said that you can open apps remotely but cannot activate them .
if it were also a feature , it would have been better .
there is pressure sensitive point support in the screen of the phone , due to this , the style of the pen changes according to the pressure .
if you have chosen thin points to make notes but you have to write a little thicker .
in such a situation , if you increase the pressure slightly on the pen , then there will be thick handwriting itself .
there will be no effect if there is even a hand touch on the screen while making a note .
during the review of the phone , we used the note in a much better way , not only came the use of making notes in the press conference , but it is also very good in painting .
like some previous models , you can also change the point of the pen , the size of the brush and the color .
apart from this , the offline note is amazing .
you can make a note by simply removing the aspen without turning on the phone screen .
apart from this , the smart selection and translation feature is also quite good .
this time the company has given the handwriting recognition feature in the note feature .
that is , you can convert it to text by writing in handwriting .
along with this , the smart selection and translation feature is also very useful for you .
when you remove the pen from samsung galaxy note 10 + , the pen features will be revealed on their own .
it has an option .
live message and screen write options were already available , but this time ar doodle has been added as a new command .
the camera becomes active as soon as the ar dual is turned on and you can make a doodle on the face before shooting video in it .
when the video is recorded , the doodle will appear on its own as soon as that face is revealed .
samsung galaxy note 10 plus &apos;s first proofing test in india .
overall , you will enjoy watching the samsung galaxy note 10 &apos;s spen feature .
aspen has its own battery and once fully charged it lasts for about 10 to 11 hours .
no need to panic here .
you do not need to charge it separately , but when you put it in the phone , it is automatically charged and in just ten minutes it is fully charged .
easy software
samsung galaxy note 10 + has been introduced on the android operating system 9 pie .
with this , you will get to see one ui 1.5 .
if you remove the note features , then it is the same as an ordinary samsung phone .
bixby home support is also provided in the phone with bixby home .
apart from samsung note , microsoft apps have also been provided in the phone .
at the same time , in addition to the ordinary google apps , the option of galaxy apps store , samsung health and samsung pay will be available .
in samsung pay , you can integrate your debit or credit card .
it has nfc support and you can pay with just one tap .
apart from the split screen in the phone , there will be an option of open in popup view , in this you can place an app in a popup and use another app .
if desired , you can reduce the opacity of the app placed in the popup .
the most important thing can be said that you can place more than one app in a popup .
the bixby vision is still fine but the bixby vice support did not seem to be much success .
because google assistant is very useful .
strong hardware
as it is known , samsung launches its flagship phone with two chipsets .
one is qualco mm and the other is exnos .
only exynos model comes in india .
this phone works on exnos 9825 processor with 7 nanometer fabrication .
in it you will find an octacore ( 2 × 2.73 ghz möngüz m4 + 2 × 2.4 ghz cortex-a75 + 4 × 1.9 ghz cortex-a55 ) processor .
along with this , the mali-g76 mp12 gpu has been given .
samsung galaxy note 10 + introduced in two memory , the company has launched it with 8 gb and 12 gb ram .
along with this , there is 256 gb and 512 gb of storage .
we had an 8 gb variant available .
in case of performance , you will not get any complaint from the phone .
in this , you open multiple apps or why run a game with large graphics .
yes , it is stuck once or twice but for this samsung needs to focus on its ui .
at the same time , despite the phone being slim and light enough , we did not find any complaints of heating anywhere .
camera amazing
samsung galaxy note 10 + has a quad camera setup .
its main camera is of 12 mp which comes with f / 1.5-2.4 aperture .
this is a variable aperture .
in this , it becomes permanent according to the light itself .
we have also seen this kind of feature in note 9 and s 10 .
that is , when the light is more , then the aperture will be less open and the aperture will become larger when the light is low , so that more light can go to the sensor and a better photo is clicked .
along with this , you will get pdaf and ois support with the main sensor .
the second sensor of the phone is of 12 mp which comes with f / 2.1 aperture .
it is a telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom support with ois .
its third sensor is f / 2.2 aperture and the company has given 16 mp sensor .
it comes with ultra wide angle support .
along with this , this sensor also has super steady video support .
that is , even if you shoot a video on the go , the video coffee will be stable .
there is a lot of improvement in the camera feature and you will see many new features .
first of all , let me say that it has video support with blur background with blur background photos .
the company has named it live focus and is also present in the video along with steel picture .
at the same time , you will also get ultra slow motion video recording with slow .
ultra slow motion video is awesome .
on motion , it automatically detects the subject and shoots slow motion video .
the camera is provided with 2x optical zoom and up to 10x digital zoom .
the phone also has pro mode where you can set shutter speed , exposure and oso by yourself .
ultravide angles can be used in both photo and video modes .
the camera is also accompanied by modes such as pro mode , panorama and auto hdr .
for video , it is capable of 4k recording .
at the same time , you will also get the feature of video editing , which can be said to be a big thing .
with this , he adds music by himself in slow motion .
it is a matter of picture quality that takes a very good and very detailed photo .
at the same time , during blur background , the edges are cut very well and the depth will be known to you .
the use of hdr is also very good and with davo it can be said that you will not get such experience of video in other phones .
what i liked best after all of this is the audio zoom feature .
this is really amazing .
when you use the zoom feature in the video , apart from doing the face detection itself , this phone will record the audio in the person who will be able to record clear sound from a distance .
for the selfie , you will get a 10-megapixel front camera with e / 2.2 aperture in samsung galaxy note 10 + .
with the selfie camera you will get ai integration and can also use doodle .
the lack of a camera can only say that it exposes the face more .
in this case , the skin becomes more smooth than necessary .
advance connectivity for
data and connectivity , it will also have wifi , bluetooth and usb type-c with 4g volte .
you will be surprised to know that this time the company has removed the hartrett sensor from the galaxy note 10 plus .
there is a health app in which you will tell your activity but you will not be able to check heart rate and stress rate .
samsung has a dex feature with the galaxy note through which you can connect your phone to the dex station and use the phone as a desktop .
but in the galaxy note 10 series , it has become one level and advanced .
now you can use it on any screen only through usb type-c and hdmi cable .
we used it during the experiment and can say it is quite fun .
you can tackle your office or personal work only through the phone .
for simple backup
power backup samsung galaxy note gave 10 + mah battery .
this is the biggest battery note ever and there is no doubt that the battery backup of the phone is better than before but still does not take a full day off even during the slightest heavy usage .
the phone has fast charging support and you can also use wireless charging .
with the charger provided with the sales pack , it is fully charged in about one and a half hours .
the company has given battery optimization in it and is quite beneficial to perform the task .
in the indian market , the price of 8 gb ram 256 gb memory variant of samsung galaxy note 10 plus is rs 79,990 .

the price of galaxy note 10 is rs 69,990 .
if you buy it from an exchange offer , hdfc card or paytm , you will get an additional rs 6,000 cashback .
looking at the price , you may find the samsung galaxy note 10 + a bit expensive , but if you see the innovation in it , then you will not say so .
the phone will get many things including a bigger screen , better processor , bigger memory , bigger battery , upgrade camera and advance aspen .
in this budget , the phone can get a tough competition from oneplus 7 pro or oneplus 7t pro and iphone 11 series , which will be launched in a few days , but let me tell you that one will be available at a slightly lower price and some will be available at a slightly higher price , but the note only samsung i will get what is best .
in the same year , opo launched its flagship reno series , under which the first pop-up camera phone with a sharkfin design was launched .
now the company has expanded this series and launched three new phones simultaneously .
the company has launched oppo reno 2 , reno 2z and reno 2f .
among these three smartphones , oppo reno 2 is the largest device launched in the flagship segment with high end specifications .
oppo reno 2 is the first smartphone to launch in india that supports quad rear camera with 20x digital zoom .
this phone has been launched by the company at a price of rs 36,990 , which became available for sale from september 20 .
oppo reno 2 can be purchased from both online and offline platforms .
the direct competition of oppo reno 2 launched in this range is from oneplus 7 .
in such a situation , can oppo reno 2 launched at a high price be called the best smartphone at this price ? by using oppo reno 2 for 10 days , we have also known the advantages and shortcomings of this phone and have presented a review of the phone .
the choice of liking or disliking any smartphone first begins with its look and the oppo reno 2 completely passes here .
its look is so magnificent that it can be liked at the first glance .
the look and design is extremely premium , enough to prove it a flagship device .
oppo reno 2 has been launched in luminous black and ocean blue color , we got to use luminous black color variant which is very fantastic .
the back panel of the phone is extremely shiny , which glows in a blue shade when illuminated .
yes , fingerprints are used here during use , but they can be easily cleaned with the palm .
the camera setup on the back panel is given below the glass layer , giving it an elegant look .
the company launched it on a full view bezel less display that supports shark fin pop-up selfie camera .
there is no notch on the front panel of the phone and on giving the command of selfie , this triangular shaped pop-up selfie camera comes out of the phone body and clicks the photo .
there is always a complaint of scratching the glass body .
in this case , the protection of corning gorilla glass has been given in the front and back panels of the phone .
the quad rear camera setup is provided on the back panel , which is present in the vertical shape .
while the volume rocker and power button are given on the side panel of the phone , the bottom panel of oppo reno 2 has a usb type-c port as well as a 3.5 mm jack .
the oppo reno 2 is offered by the company at a 20 : 9 aspect ratio that supports a 2400 x 1080 pixel resolution 6.5-inch fullhd + dynamic amoled display .
its display is a 401ppi support carrier with 16 million color reflections , available with a 1400000 : 1 contrast ratio .
at the same time , you get a brightness of 430nits .
due to these features , when viewing gaming and video , you get a very clear and high quality viewer experience .
the screen-to-body ratio of the phone is 93.1 percent and the bezels are extremely light .
this phone is equipped with in-display fingerprint sensor 3.0 technology , in which the device unlocks very fast when you touch the screen .
the corning gorilla 6 has been used on the front panel to protect the display .
the display brightness of oppo reno 2 has been good both indoor and outdoor .
yes , the display is definitely a bit personal .
users running the phone with one hand will have to take some extra precautions , as this phone also slips due to the smooth panel .
oppo is the camera segment of the biggest usp phone of reno 2 .
it is the first smartphone launched in india that supports 20x digital zoom and 5x hybrid zoom with quad rear camera .
a 48 mp sony imx586 primary sensor with f / 1.7 aperture has been given on the back panel of the phone , which works with eis anti shake technology .
the advantage of this is that even if the hand shakes during photography and videography , it will adjust a bit and the photo and video will not blur .
along with this , the phone has 8 mp 116-degree ultraviolet lens + 13 mp telephoto lens with f / 2.4 aperture + 2 mp mono lens with 1.75um large pixels support .
oppo reno 2 supports 16-megapixel ai front camera for selfie and video calling .
talking about the biggest strength of the camera i.e. 20x digital zoom , it captures the photo with maxim zoom but the quality of the photo is not very good .
here , let us tell you that this result has been as expected and the object detail in the photo with 20x zoom has been captured fine on average .
however , zoom is better if you use it with a tripod .
there is always a fear of moving in the hand .
at the same time , clicking on 5x and 10x zoom , the photo quality is also not great but it will be said .
the other quality ultra steady video feature of oppo reno 2 camera has also been excellent .
we shot video in a moving car which has been largely stable .
let us know that this feature of oppo reno 2 makes static video even when the camera is moving , but in this situation , the text content becomes blur when any written matter like boards or hoardings are exposed .
at the same time , ultra dark mode of the phone also captures great photos at night .
the portrait mode of the phone is good which captures the object and the back ground well .
along with this , the sensor also manages the color and brightness very well .
the phone has an &apos; expert &apos; mode which improves the lighting conditions in the outdoor .
talking about selfie camera at the same time , &apos; boke &apos; mode will also be found here , which works quite smooth .
it is worth noting that the photos we took from oppo reno 2 are amazing and the good thing is that to brighten the photo , the oppo reno 2 phone does not compromise the photo &apos;s reality and does not give you an artificial look .
the special thing is that oppo reno 2 &apos;s selfie camera supports free fall detection technology .
oppo reno 2 has been introduced on android 9.0 pie based coloros 6.1 os which runs on qualco mm &apos;s snapdragon 730g chipset with octa-core processor .
in india , this smartphone supports 256 gb of internal storage with 8 gb ram memory .
this phone has lpddr 4x ram and ufs2.1 technology .
the phone user interface felt quite smooth during use .
although many people do not like color os very much but i found it very user friendly .
talking about performance , in oppo reno 2 we played games like pubg and asphalt 9 and this experience was quite fun .
this phone is equipped with gameboost 2.0 technology and indeed there was no lag or hang-like problem during gaming .
while the performance of the phone has been quite smooth , the graphics have also sharpened while playing the game .
high quality visual experience is found while playing the game and in racing games like asphalt 9 it has not slowed down anywhere .
although not in gaming , but after opening the camera of the phone , it has been hanged twice in which the phone has blackout .
as far as i know , this is the problem of color os .
app crashes have been with this os before .
for power backup , this phone has a strong battery of 4,000 mah .
to fast charge large batteries , opo has equipped this phone with vooc flash charge 3.0 technology which supports super fast charging via usb type c cable .
while launching the phone , oppo claimed that this phone gets up to 51 percent charge in 30 minutes .
when we put the phone on charge , in half an hour the battery of the phone increased from 12 percent to 67 percent , i.e. 45 percent .
during this time , data , wi-fi and location service were on the phone , then it would be considered a good charging speed .
on the other hand , once full charge is given to oppo reno 2 , it easily removes a full day .
after full charge of the phone , we used it regularly , in which whatsapp , voice calls , internet surfing , music for about 2 hours and watched the webseries on netflix for so long .
the phone &apos;s battery gives a good backup .
the price of oppo reno 2 in the indian market is rs 36,990 .
the company has not compromised with the look and features are also good .
it has a usp camera and that too does not disappoint you .
photo taken from both front camera or rear is excellent .
this phone is also able to provide a good experience to gaming users .
the performance of the phone has been excellent , yes it crashed a couple of times but it will be fixed in the software update .
overall , young people will love oppo reno 2 and it also has the potential to become a style symbol .
but there are two big challenges before it .
एक oneplus 7 और दूसरा खुद oppo reno ।
for a little money , at a slightly higher price .
while the oneplus 7 is available in a budget of rs 32,999 with qualco mm snapdragon 855 chipset , the oppo reno can be taken for rs 39,999 .
this phone also has qualco mm snapdragon 855 processor and the camera is quite powerful .
despite this , if you like the style with the feature , then of course oppo reno 2 is a good deal .
in february this year , samsung launched the m series for online and the company first introduced the galaxy m20 .
after this , the galaxy m10 and m30 were launched a few days later .
although there was a lot of discussion about the entire m series , but the galaxy m30 was well liked among the indian users .
the reason for this was the powerful device at a low price .
at the same time , the company has introduced its upgraded version galaxy m30s .
although the leaks of the phone had come long ago , but about a month ago , the company itself had told that this phone will get a 6,000 mah battery .
this is samsung &apos;s biggest battery phone ever .
now when this phone has been launched , users will definitely want to know what else is special about it besides the battery ? along with this , it will also be curious whether the new phone will replicate the popularity of the old model ? so let us answer all these questions in our review .
at the same time , we will also try to know whether it has the power to give a tough competition to phones like xiaomi and vivo available in the market ? let us begin the review with a design .
the body of the samsung galaxy m30s is made of glossy polycarbonate .
built quality is good and in terms of look is also good .
however , it cannot be called the best .
in this budget , xiaomi , vivo and realme have glass finish phones which look more attractive .
yes the shape and size of the phone is very good .
the design is compact and can be curved .
it feels very comfortable to hold in such a situation .
appreciate the company for its weight .
despite the large battery of 6,000 mah , it will not feel heavy .
the weight is balanced quite well .
the matter of the phone &apos;s buttons and ports is similar to that of an ordinary samsung phone .
this phone has three slots where you will be able to use a microsd card with two sims .
flash with triple rear camera setup is available in the rear panel .
even earlier , the samsung galaxy m30 had a triple camera , which was given in a line on the left side .
but this time more space has been taken for the camera .
the flash is lifted from under the camera to the right .

camera itself has a fingerprint scanner below .
the bottom panel has a 3.5 mm audio jack , usb typec port and loudspeaker grill .
coming to the front , there is a small notch at the top of the screen where the selfie camera is available .
with this , where the screen ends , a small earpiece has been given at the top .
overall it can be said that the design is clean but not new .
yes , it can definitely be said that it is solid and strong .
the samsung galaxy m30s has a larger 6.4-inch screen .
above the screen in the phone , you will see water drop notch , which has been named infinity u by samsung .
although the company claims that this notch is smaller than before but we did not see much difference in the look .
yes , it can be said that like the old phone , it also has a super amoled display , but this time the price is lower than the old model .
the phone has a full hd plus screen with 19.5 : 9 aspect ratios .
the company has used a 2.5d curved display .
where some phones appear above the screen body .
at the same time , it is with the body .

today , bezel-less phones are in trend and the company has kept it bezel-free to a great extent .
there will be very less bezels on three sides but little is seen at the bottom .
the thing is that the display quality is excellent and the touch response is also very good .
after the simple look , we were very happy to see the display .
samsung galaxy m30s runs on the company &apos;s own exynos 9611 chipset .
in the phone , you will see an octa-core processor with 2.3 ghz clock speed .
this phone comes with 64 gb memory with 4 gb ram and 128 gb memory with 6 gb ram .
we had a phone with 6 gb ram memory and it was available for about 3.7 gb users .
at the same time , there is about 109 gb free space in storage .
the phone has microsd card support and you can use cards up to 512 gb .
talking about the performance of galaxy m30s , you will not get any problem from anywhere .
this processor of the exonus 900 series is quite good and in the budget of rs 15,000 , it will be called very excellent .
it does the work of daily routine easily , you will not miss anything .
at the same time , for gaming , the company has equipped a gaming booster which renders the graphics quite fast .
in such a situation , when you play high graphics games like pubg or rule of survival , then it will feel much faster than the old phone .
we have no complaints about the performance of the phone .
the samsung galaxy m30s has been introduced by the company on the android 9 pie operating system .
on the same phone , you will get to see oneui 1.5 .
although in use it is very similar to the old galaxy m30 .
in it you will find preloaded apps like netflix , amazon shopping , amazon prime video , snapchat and dailyhunt .
however what we found special is microsoft office swit .
you will be able to use office apps on your phone for free .
samsung started always on display from galaxy s and note series and now you will get that feature in this phone too .
there will also be options like smart view .
apart from this, the phone has wildwine l1 support, its advantage is that you will be secure on your data on apps like netflix.
another good thing for users is that the company has claimed that the galaxy m30s will also be updated with android 10 .
the company has not told the time but may announce it after the android 10 launch .
looking at the samsung galaxy m30s , you can say that the company has come fully prepared this time .
after the features and specifications , its camera is also strong .
in this , you will get to see triple rear camera sensor .
the main camera of the phone is 48-megapixels and the company has introduced it with f / 2.0 aperture .
at the same time , the second sensor of the phone is 8-megapixels and it comes with f / 2.2 aperture .
it is an ultra-wide angle sensor that supports up to 123 degree angle .
along with this , the third sensor is 5-megapixels .
it also comes with an f / 2.2 aperture that performs dipthensing .
with the camera , the company has given ai support which adjusts the photo itself according to the scene .
talking about the other features of the camera , you will get options like food mode and night mode in this phone .
the company says that night mode has become much better than before .
you can guess it in the photo .
apart from this , options such as your live focus , slow motion , super slow motion and pro mode will also be available .
as we told that this phone has a 48 mp camera , but to take a photo on this megapixel , you will have to go to settings and turn it on .
you will find this option at the top .
it is very good about quality .
you can also experience it yourself in the photos below .
if you click on the photo at 48 mp , it also takes a little time to save it .
clicks heavily photo .
even in the case of video , it is not far behind .
it has 4k video support .
at the same time , it is difficult to match the slow motion of samsung in this price range .
it has wide angle support with both photo and video which would be said to be very good .
this phone has a 16 mp front camera for selfie .
with the camera , you will get the option of live focus .
we can also do this option in old samsung phones .
the quality of selfie in the phone is good but we cannot say best .
in samsung galaxy m30s you will get three slots .
you can use a microsd card in addition to two sims simultaneously .
the phone has dual 4g support .
at the same time , usb type-c has been given for data and connectivity .
the face is unlocked except for fingerprint scanners for security .
at the same time , the company has introduced it with dolby admos integration and is known for its superior music quality .
as we have mentioned in the beginning that the phone has a battery of 6,000 mah and this is the first phone of the company which has such a large battery .
it has fast charging support of 15 watts and if you fully charge once , it removes two days comfortably during normal use .
even if you are a very heavy user , there is nothing to worry about , you will not have to charge even during the day &apos;s use .
the 4 gb ram model of samsung galaxy m30s in the indian market is priced at rs 13,999 .
at the same time , for the model with 6 gb ram , you have to pay rs 16,999 .
प ् राइस रेंज के हिसाब से यदि आप फीचर ् स और स ् पेसिफिकेशन की तुलना करें तो यह एक बेहतरीन डिवाइस कहा जाएगा ।
yes the look is a bit simple but an all-rounder phone .
you get a super amoled screen with flower view display .
it also has a 48 mp triple rear camera and a superb processor .
larger batteries and fast charging further increase its usability .
yes , in this budget , the phone will get a tough competition from realme 5 pro and vivo z1 pro but this phone will not prove to be any less .
apple launched the iphone 11 series yesterday .
although it was a global launch , the company also announced the india launch date and price .
this phone will be available for sale in india from 27 september .
as for the price , it starts at rs 64,900 and goes up to rs 1,41,900 .
like every time , but this time there is a lot of discussion .
if someone is happy to see the features of the phone , then someone is complaining about the price .
though the grievances are in place , but the biggest question is whether the iphone 11 is better than the samsung galaxy note 10 ? like all times , this time rip rivals samsung and apple are in front .
last month samsung launched the galaxy note 10 series and this phone is also in the premium category .
there is not much difference in terms of price as well and both phones have their separate fans .
note where aspen is popular worldwide .
at the same time , apple has won iron for its excellent quality performance .
if you are thinking of taking one of these two phones , then before that you can see this small comparison based on specifications and features , which will help you in choosing a better phone .

whether it is design , display , features camera or battery .
at the same time , except for the standard model , the iphone 11 series is very high in terms of price .
in such a situation , if you were thinking of taking apple iphone 11 , then change your plan and take samsung galaxy note 10 plus , it is better .
last week , samsung launched the galaxy m40 model in india .
the price of this phone in the indian market is rs 19,990 and like other m series phones , it will also be available only on online stores .
from june 18 , samsung galaxy m40 can be purchased from the online store amazon india and samsung estore .
this is the most expensive phone of samsung &apos;s m series at the moment , but you will also be surprised to know that where samsung is accused of being valuable so far .
at the same time , the galaxy m40 is currently the lowest priced punch hole display phone .
in such a situation , you will definitely want to know what else is special in this apart from the punch hole display .
at the same time , would also like to know whether this phone is worth shopping ! because in this budget , there are also bulky devices like realme 3 pro and redmi note 7 pro ? so , in this review , we answer all your questions .
stylish look the
phone is sleek and quite compact .
this phone is made of polycarbonate plastic in a glass finish .
the built quality of the phone is good and very comfortable to hold .
despite the glass , there is not much fingerprint on the rear panel .

talking about slots and hardware button placement is a bit different .
previously , samsung phones used to see the power button on one side and the volume rocker on the other .
at the same time , this phone has both the hardware buttons in the right panel while the sim slot is given on the left side .
there may be some problem for you here .
the second slot in the phone is hybrid where you can use only one of the sims or cards .
in the lower panel , you will see a loudspeaker grill with usb type-c , in the past the panel has flash with triple camera setup and a fingerprint scanner nearby .
overall the design is good but you will miss the 3.5 mm audio jack .
you have to connect the earphone to the usb type-c port in the phone .
however the good thing can be said here that type-c earphones are available with the sales pack .

sound comes from the back screen
although it is only part of the design but it is so special that it is necessary to mention separately .
this phone does not have an earpiece .
that is , the speaker you put on the ear while talking is not there .
the top is completely empty .
the company has introduced it with screen sound cast technology where you will hear the sound anywhere on the screen during calling .
during the review we made a lot of calls from it and it was working properly .
yes ! while talking , it felt like the sound was coming out of a pipe but there was no problem of any kind .
rather once we were talking with the screen upside down , the voice was coming .
but when you turn the screen upside down , your voice does not go away .

there is a hole in the top left of the screen , which has a selfie camera .
touch works here though .
in such a situation , you will not have any problem while playing games or using the screen .
yes , one can definitely complain that it does not have amoled display .
because before this , the company has also used amoled panels in the lower range m30 .

this phone has a 6.3-inch screen and comes with 19.5 : 9 aspect ratios .
the screen resolution of the phone is 1080 x 2340 pixels ( full hd + ) and it has a 2.5d curved display .

this is the first phone in the m series to come on snapdragon .
earlier , all samsung &apos;s were available on the exynos chipset .
it has a 2.0 ghz octacore ( 2 × 2.0 ghz cryo 460 gold + 6 × 1.7 ghz cryo 460 silver ) processor .
along with this , there is an adreno 612 gpu .
the company has introduced it with 6 gb ram memory and 128 gb storage .
it is currently available in a single memory option .
it has expandable memory support and you can use cards up to 512 gb .
users get about 3.5 gb of ram free of 6 gb .
at the same time , about 102 gb of storage will be available out of 128 gb for storage .
the rest of the system goes into the file .
speaking of performance , we have seen phones with qualco mm snapdragon 675 chipset even before .
in the mid range , it is known for its superior performance .
although today phones are available with this processor even at a much lower price than this , if snapdragon 700 series chipset would have been called the best .
we do not have much complaint with the performance of the phone but it was taking a lot of time in loading heavy apps .
at the same time , there were problems in opening the apps .
it will definitely be magnified that heating problems were not found during gaming .
the daily task was easy to handle .
slow software works on the
samsung galaxy m40 android operating system 9 pie and in this you will get to see samsung &apos;s oneui 1.1 .
icon coffees have grown in the new one ui which are easy to use .
however , in the phone settings , you can adjust the size of the icon yourself .
at the same time , you can also change the control button .
the phone will get finger sensor gestures with list to wake , smart stay , smart alert and easy mute .
in smart stay , as long as you see it in the screen it will remain on and then it will be locked .
at the same time , in finger sensor gestures , you can control notifications with fingerprint scanners .
apart from google , apps from samsung , amazon and microsoft have also been provided in the phone .
you can uninstall some apps , including amazon , but not all preloaded apps can be uninstalled .
although it was a good thing for me to have microsoft apps .
there is no doubt that it is easy to use and samsung &apos;s new one ui has become very good with the old touchwiz ui .
but it is still slow and there are problems with many apps .
slow motion is amazing like
samsung galaxy m20 and m30 , this phone also comes with triple rear camera setup .
it has a 32 mp main camera and has been introduced with f / 1.7 archer .
the company has pdaf support with this camera which is known for fast focus .
the large aperture works quite well in low light .
the second camera is 8 mp and the company has introduced it with f / 2.2 aperture .
it has a wide angle support of 123 degrees , which would be very good .
at the same time , there is also pdaf support .
the third camera of the
samsung galaxy m40 unboxing phone is 5 mp and it comes with f / 2.2 aperture .
that is , it is used during the blur back ground .
to take a picture at 32 mp you need to turn it on .
when you turn on the camera , the ratio option will appear at the top .
in 3 : 4h ratio , it clicks the picture at 32 mp . with the camera , you will get panorama , pro and live focus , plus the option of slow motion and super slow motion .
along with this , another good thing about the camera is that there is ultra wide angle support in the video along with the photos .
you will definitely like its rear camera .
in daylight condition , it takes a very good picture and the colors are very bright .
the photo will look real .
at the same time , if you turn to low light , then there will be a huge burden on other phones available in this budget .
you cannot set the resolution in slow motion but shoots quite well .
after phone usage , it can be said that its equal slow motion and wide angle are not equal in this budget .
supports resolution of up to 2k for video recording and video quality is also good .
it also captures sound well during recording .
for selfie , this phone has 16 mp camera which comes with f / 2.0 aperture .
options such as wide angle and live focus are also available with selfie camera .
while in the rear camera , it has the power to leave anyone behind in the budget of 20 thousand rupees , while in the case of selfie , the redmi note 7 pro is slightly behind .
the picture quality of the front camera is good but the redmi 7 pro overshadows it .
this dual sim based phone has 4g volte support.
along with this , the phone also has wifi and bluetooth .
the company has introduced it with nfc support .
there will also be an option of screen mirroring .
dolby atmos integration is provided for music .
there is a fingerprint scanner in the rear panel for security .
along with this , there is also face unlock support .
the fingerprint scanner is quite fast .
face is left slightly behind in unlock .
the samsung galaxy m40 has a 3,500 mah battery and the company has introduced it with fast charging support .
it takes about one and a half hours to fully charge when fully discharged .
speaking of battery backup , phones with up to 5,000 mah battery are available today .
in this case , it will take you a little less but let me tell you that battery backup is good .
once full charged , it easily removes the entire day .
apart from this , there is a power mode feature which will help you a lot when you have low battery .
the samsung galaxy m40 is priced at rs 19,990 .
the galaxy m40 is a good phone in this budget .
yes , if seen on paper , the redmi note 7 pro looks strong and the price is also low .
but except for a few things , the m40 does not remain behind , but will be seen further in terms of punch hole display and screen sound cast .
at the same time , the camera megapixels in redmi may be high , but in terms of picture quality , the m40 is nowhere behind .
along with this , it is heavy in slow motion and wide angle .
in such a situation , it can be said that the price is not a problem for you , then samsung galaxy m40 is a good phone and you can buy it .
samsung launched its new online exclusive series &quot; m &quot; in india this year .
the company started with the galaxy m20 and galaxy m10 .
after this , galaxy m30 was introduced .
today , samsung has introduced the fourth phone in this series , the galaxy m40 .
while all three phones of the m series were considered strong in specification , this time the company has launched it with many new innovations .

, we saw this earlier in samsung &apos;s premium phone galaxy s10 .
with the samsung galaxy m40 , the company has started the infinity o display in low-range phones .
emoled display was seen in samsung phones till now in this range , but the display of galaxy m40 is not amoled .
the company has used the ips lcd display .
however , you will not have any complaints with the display .
it is quite sharp and touch response is also better .
the initial experience was quite good .
screen sound casting
you may be surprised to know that the samsung galaxy m40 does not have an earpiece .
that is , it is not the speaker that you hear on the ears .
this phone has screen sound cast technology where you will put the screen on the ear from anywhere and the voice will keep coming .
we saw this earlier in vivo nex .
we checked it and found that it was working correctly .
yes , the voice was getting a little echoed .
this phone has been introduced on qualco mm snapdragon 675 chipset .
in the phone , you will see a 2.0 ghz octacore ( 2 × 2.0 ghz cryo 460 gold + 6 × 1.7 ghz cryo 460 silver ) processor .
it is considered a good processor for the mid-range .
however , snapdragon 675 chipset is also available in the budget of rs 12,000 today .
in such a situation , we were hoping for something better .
adreno 612 gpu has been given for graphics .
the company has given it the strength of 6 gb ram memory .
there is an option of 128 gb for storage .
this phone will currently be available in a single memory option .
it has memory card support and you can use cards up to 512 gb .
if you talk about the performance of the phone , i will not talk more about it now .
now we have used it for almost a day but we did not see the leg anywhere .
yes , it was a bit slow because of the samsung ui .
samsung galaxy m40 works on android operating system 9 pie and in it you will get to see samsung &apos;s one ui 1.1 .
in it you will get to see some gesture based uis which are quite good .
the galaxy m40 has been introduced by the company with triple rear camera setup .
the main camera of the phone is 32 mp and it comes with f / 1.7 archer .
the company has introduced it with pdaf support .
the second sensor comes with 8 mp , f / 2.2 aperture .
it also has pdaf support .

with the camera , you will also get the option of live focus , pro mode and slow motion video .

can &apos;t talk too much about camera quality right now .
but the initial photos were good .
this dual sim based phone has 4g volte support .
the phone has a usb type-c port for data transfer .
there is a fingerprint scanner in the rear panel for security .
price and availability
the samsung galaxy m40 is priced at rs 19,990 and this phone will be available for sale on june 18 from the online store amazon india and at the samsung online store.
oneplus 6 and later 6g were launched last year .
this time there was a lot of discussion about oneplus 7 phone .
however , about a month before the launch , news came that the company could offer two models this time and this happened .
along with oneplus 7 , the company also launched oneplus 7 pro pro .
the most special thing was that the pro variant became available for the first sale and we also had the same phone for review .
pro , as the name suggests , is a big variant of the standard edition of oneplus 7 and many things are advanced from oneplus 7 .
at the same time , there is a great difference in price .
the starting price of oneplus 7 pro in the indian market is rs . 48,999 and samsung &apos;s s10 series is also available in this range , which is known for great performance with the best look .
in this case , the oneplus , which is called the flagship killer , directly competes with the flagship .
now the question arises whether the brand should go towards samsung or oneplus is the best .
let us find out in this review .

unique design
oneplus 6t was highly appreciated in terms of design and oneplus 7 pro is a step ahead in this matter .
the phone back panel is made of glass , which has a very good quality .
on the other hand , curved body gives a very good feeling .
yes , it is a bit more smooth , in such a situation , there is always the fear of slipping by hand , but a silicon cover is provided with the sales pack .
the most important thing is that even after the glass body , the fingerprint marks in the previous panel are not equal .
we came to the blue variant review of oneplus 7 pro which has been introduced in metallic gradient color .
but its gradient is completely different from others and gives a smooth feel .
all the three cameras are available inside the cylinder shape in the rear panel of the phone and flash and then the company logo will be seen outside it .
turning to the side panel , the right and vibration buttons and the power button are given , while the left side is the volume rocker .
a pop-up camera at the top and a sim slot , usb type c slot and loudspeaker grill are provided at the bottom .
the phone does not have a memory card and there is only one slot for the sim .
a sim tray itself has both the top and bottom sims .
we have seen this kind of placement in huawei phones before .
come to the front , as you know , it has a pop camera .
in such a situation , no knock or bezel will be seen .
in the bottom also the bezels have reduced considerably .
overall the design looks quite luxurious and feels of premium quality .
if you turn to the design flaw after the quality , first of all you will say that you will find it very heavy to hold the phone for the first time .
today , the screen in the phone has become larger and the weight is also around 180 grams .
but it weighs 206 grams and appears to weigh a bit .
the other deficiency will be called cover .
silicon cover has been provided with the phone , while in the budget of rs 50,000 you hope for better quality .
such a cover would have been available in the budget of rs 5,000 today .
apart from this , you can say that now that oneplus has become expensive then it should have been water and dust proof .
because its competitors like samsung and apple are present in this budget and this feature is available in them .
in such a situation , you can leave the other shortcomings , but the lack of water proof and dust proof will be considered a big drawback .
sharp display
oneplus 7 pro has a 6.67-inch amoled screen .
the screen of the phone is quite large and will be felt when taken in hand .
with one hand you will not be able to use the whole screen .
the company has introduced it with qhd resolution and it is corning gorilla glass 5 coated .
the fully bezel less aspect ratio of its screen is 19.5 : 9 .
at the same time it can be said that it has 90hz refresh rate support .
it is the first phone in the world to support 90hz refresh rate for display .
today many smart tvs have 60hz refresh rate support , in which case it will be called very special .
the advantage of this is that when you watch the video , it will make you feel smoother than other phones .
although the content of 90hz refresh rate is very low in online streaming today , one can say that oneplus is at the forefront of technology .
apart from this , the screen of the phone is hdr 10 + compatible .
that is , you will have a very real feeling in the phone .
one can say that the display is the best .
powerful hardware
design , although you can find a shortcoming , but oneplus has been very strong in the hardware segment and you cannot remove it too .
this is the first phone in india that has been introduced on the qualco mm snapdragon 855 chipset .
it is currently one of the most powerful chipsets for mobile .
the phone has an octacore processor and three different clock speed processors have been used for this .
there is a single core processor with 2.8 ghz clock speed .
the second processor is triple core and supports up to 2.42 ghz clock speed .
the third processor is octacore , which supports clock speeds up to 1.80 ghz .
in the indian market , this phone is available in 128 gb memory with 6 gb ram and 256 gb memory with 8 gb and 12 gb ram .
there is no memory card support and you have to depend on the phone memory .
however , this memory is not less .
it is very important to mention one thing here .
this phone has been introduced by the company with ufs 3.0 storage .
it is the fastest technique of data transfer and also consumes less power .
you will also realize this during data transfer in the phone .
if you are processing the matter , then you can do anything with this phone , it will not slow down .
play pubg or multi tasking . it is able to handle every task easily .
if you play a game like pubg on high graphics mode , it doesn &apos;t matter .
after the use of the phone , it can be said as a decision that it is one of the fastest phones .
smart os
oneplus 7 pro has been introduced with the android operating system 9 pie .
you will get to see the oxygen ui in the phone .
although in use it is similar to stock android but the company has made some changes .
it has a zen mode option .
as soon as you turn it on , your phone will not work for 20 minutes .
in the phone , you will find options such as dark mode , night mode and reading mode .
there is also an option to change the home screen layout and icon size .
the good thing about the os can also be said that it will not get much preloaded apps apart from google and amazon .
the thing about ui is quite simple and you will not have any problem .
pop-up camera in
oneplus 7 pro where triple rear camera setup will be seen in the back panel .
at the same time , a pop-up camera setup has been given for the selfie .
this is the first time the company has introduced a phone with a pop-up camera .
the main sensor of the phone is f / 1.6 aperture and the company has equipped it with a 48-megapixel sony imx5867 p lens .
this sensor supports optical image stabilization technology .
along with this , the second sensor is 8-megapixel telephoto lens .
the third sensor in this is 16-megapixels , and has been given for wide-angle .
this sensor supports 117-degree field of view .
if you compare its camera with the old phone , it will affect you greatly .
but the camera technology has changed the most in a year and in this range , the opo reno 10x zoom and samsung galaxy s10 falls heavily on this phone .
not only this , let me also tell you that in normal mode you cannot take a picture of 48 mp .
for this , you have to turn on pro mode .
pro mode is available in the phone &apos;s settings .
in normal photo mode , instead of pixel resolution , the option to change the aspect ratio is given .
you can click pixels in 4 : 3 , 1 : 1 and full display ratio .
in pro mode , in addition to the ordinary jpeg , 48 mp jpeg and raw photo option has been given .
raw images are mainly used by photographers .
these are very heavy images and they are easy to edit .
turning to video , oneplus 7 pro has 4k video recording .
apart from this , there is also slo mo support .
for slow motion it shoots at 1080 pixels at 240 frames per second .
there is no option to change pixels and frames .
the good thing can be said that where in samsung you can capture small slow-mo video .
at the same time it gives you a little more time .
the oneplus 7 pro has a 16-megapixel camera with a pop-up style for selfies .
the company has used sony imx471 sensor for better picture .
it comes with sensor 2.0 aperture and it has eis support .
the phone &apos;s selfie camera is also good , it cannot be called top .
google phones go far ahead in this matter .
network and connectivity
oneplus 7 pro has dual sim support and both sims are in the same slot .
it supports 4g volte and also has wifi and bluetooth .
although outside the company has said to introduce 5g variant of oneplus 7 pro but will not come in india yet .
although there is no 5g network in india , there is still no benefit by bringing a phone , but users always want more .
there is no shortage , but it would have been better .
it is equipped with almost all advanced features for security .
these display fingerprint scanners have been given in the phone .
along with this , face unlock is also available .
however , after the use of these features , it can be said that all phones available in the market are faster and fingerprint and face unlock does not fail quickly .
nfc is also given in the phone .
great battery backup
oneplus 7 pro has a battery of 4,000 mah .
the company has introduced it with fast charging and it is really amazing .
fully charged in less than an hour .
if you turn to battery backup , it will not disappoint you there either .
if you use an average and are not a heavy gamer , then one day you get rid of it comfortably .
overall the battery segment is satisfactory .
there is no doubt that the oneplus 7 pro pro is a great device .
but earlier where oneplus was called the flagship killer , this time you can call it flagship but the killer cannot say that in the budget of rs 50,000 now it has also come in the flagship segment .
yes , the performance is very good and the popup camera makes its style more special .
built quality is also premium as per budget and battery backup is also excellent .
turning to deficiencies , the camera will not disappoint you , but it cannot be called the best .
apart from this , the lack of water proof and the non-availability of wireless charging also puts it behind other flagship .
ultimately , the question is whether to take samsung galaxy s10 or oneplus 7 pro .
according to me , if you go towards performance , then it is better to take oneplus .
but if you want a great flagship with style , then it is better to take the galaxy s10 .
not only this , the recently launched opo reno is also a good option .
the opo reno camera available with the shark fin pop-up camera is much better and available with the same processor .
not only this , it is also ahead in terms of style and there is a difference of about 9,000 rupees in the price .
it is said that music is the biggest stress reliever .
if good music is able to eradicate the day &apos;s fatigue .
but to listen to good music , it is important that you also have a good music player .
nowadays wireless is the trend of headphones and earphones .
wireless music player devices of anenco brands are available in the market which provide great features and sound quality in various price segments .
one of these is the starboy wireless headphone with mic made by the nu republic brand . this gadget not only provides a great experience of listening to music but also provides access to phone calls .
we also used it to test the ability of the starboy wireless headphone and whether it was a wireless headphone that fit the true budget .
if you are also planning to get a new wireless headphone , then our written review can be of great use to you .
we received a black color model of the nu republic starboy wireless headphone for the review .
this color looked great on headphones .
yes , can &apos;t say too much interactive .
the headband and over-ear have a foam coating that is extremely soft .
power buttons are given on the front view and volume buttons on the back view .
the audio cable and usb port along with the mic are located on the lower view .
this wireless headphone from nu republic is capable of turning up to 180 degrees .
starboy has been branded on the headband of the headphone .
the company has described the dimensions of the starboy wireless headphone as 4.5 x 16.7 x 19 cm and weighs 200 grams .
on behalf of the company , this headphone has been launched in white and red color in addition to black .
easy pairing
pairing a starboy wireless headphone from any device is very easy .
in addition to pressing the power button , the bluetooth in it also turns on .
you can search this headphone by turning on bluetooth in your phone or laptop .
by default this headphone comes with the name &apos; nu starboy &apos; .
with a single click , it pairs with that device .
the good thing is that if the headphone is to be connected to another device , it becomes ready to pair only on restarting it .
the starboy wireless headphone can remain connected to bluetooth for up to 10 meters .
regardless of how great the sound
of comfort headphones is in use , or how great the look is , its real luxury is not found until its use is comfortable .
wireless headphones sound heavy on the head and neck while listening to songs for long periods of time .
but this problem has not been seen with nu republic &apos;s starboy wireless headphone .
the use of this headphone has proved to be comfortable due to the reduced weight of the headphone and the soft foam on the earcap and band .
yes , the headband would have been better if it were slightly less wide .
the first and main reason for buying
sound ban de deewana headphone is its music and sound .
there is no doubt that the sound of the starboy wireless headphone is very good .
the balance of both trouble and base is excellent in headphones .
the song &apos;s base does not burst even when the volume is increased , the vocal voice also does not suppress as the base increases .
the starboy wireless headphone features both stereo and mono sound effects .
the starboy wireless headphone from nu republic is equipped with a 50 mm neodymium driver built on multiple-transition diaphragms .
let me tell you that the more air the neodymium magnets remove in any headphone , the better and more volume is produced .
this is the reason that starboy wireless headphone provides clear sound even when full volume is done .
in this headphone , surround sound is available in 3d quality .
the inbuilt mic
comes with the nu republic brand &apos;s wireless headphone inbuilt mic .
talking on the phone call can be done through this mic , while the command can also be given to the personal assistant of the phone .
we connected the starboy wireless headphone to apple iphone and mac laptop .
siri faced a slight problem when commanding on the iphone .
starboy wireless headphone found it difficult to hear commands at once .
if you are somewhere outdoors , then there may be a problem in talking to the headphone wireless mic over the phone .
बैटरी बैकअप
although nu republic has kept the mah of the battery given in the starboy wireless headphone a secret , the company claims that it gives up to 8 hours of backup once full charged .
during the use , we have found the company &apos;s claim to be absolutely correct .
once in charge , the headphone has been playing songs continuously from 10 : 30 am to 7 : 00 pm .
in a one-time charge , the starboy wireless headphone battery has backed up more than 8 hours .
however , it can not be said whether the battery backup of this headphone is also reduced after the address becomes old .
starboy wireless headphone is being sold by nu republic on the company &apos;s website for rs 1,499 .
on the shopping site amazon , this wireless headphone is available for sale at rs 999 .
the starboy wireless headphone from nu republic is average in terms of look .
talking about the sound quality , the starboy wireless headphone gives the best results here .
the music quality of this headphone is excellent .
at the same time , the battery backup of the headphone is also very good , which will support you during the long journey .
the company price of the headphone is not too much , while on amazon , this headphone is being sold at an even cheaper price .
yes , there may be some problem in connection with the phone , but if you are thinking of buying this headphone for music purposes only , then it will live up to your expectations .
in today &apos;s time , almost everyone is fond of listening to music .
but , some like to listen to music on the speaker , some like to listen to the songs in their headphones / earphones without disturbing anyone .
at the same time , companies are offering their products according to the requirement of all users in the market .
meanwhile , the indian electronic company tagg is trying to make its move .
tagg has been launching its bluetooth earphones / headphones in the indian market for quite some time .
at the same time , once again the company is trying to woo users on the basis of its new bluetooth headphones .
here we are talking about tagg powerbass-700 , using which we tried to find out if this is the best for you .
one of the reasons that this headphones are popular
with the bluetooth headphones launched by the company is the 3.5 mm jack ending in the phone .
you do not have long wire tension in bluetooth headphones .
at the same time , bluetooth headphones are good for those who like to listen to music along with workouts .
apart from this , they are also very effective in this crowded area .
let us know that the powerbass-700 bluetooth headphone is an upgraded version of the powerbass-400 launched by the company .

in this , a good quality fabric has been used in the given cup .
there are three buttons on the underside of the right cup .
one of these buttons to turn headphones on .
at the same time , the volume can be reduced and accelerated by up and down of a single button .
apart from this , there is another button in the headphone which is for the base .
apart from this , the microusb port and 3.5 mm jack will be available for charging downwards in the right cup , i.e. after the battery of the headphones is down , users will be able to listen to music with the help of wire .

the sound effect of this bluetooth headphone is good .
but , its biggest feature is the base given in it .
if you are fond of listening to hip-hop songs , then it will not disappoint you .
however , a faster base may bother you in a short time .
but , with the help of the base button provided in the headphones , you can say that you can turn its base on and off .
at the same time , you also get good battery life .
also , there will be no issue of audio quality in voice calls .
in this , my voice was heard very clearly on the other hand during the call in the given microphone .
we had no problem connecting the headphones to the smartphone .
but , if you have trouble connecting it , you long press the power button , so that the headphone goes into restart mode and gets connected to the smartphone .
if you increase the volume slightly in this headphone , then the outside voice will be less .
at the same time , if you loud the volume of the phone , it provides very good noise canceling .
if you live in metro city and travel by public transport then you will like it a lot .
overall , the performance of this headphone can be called great .
however , according to its price it can be said to be good .
battery life
if you talk about battery life , then the company claims that it gives 14 hours of music play time , given the battery in this riff wireless .
the headphones can be charged in 2-3 hours .
there is no indication of any indication in the phone about its battery , so it is difficult to know about the battery of the headphones .
however , once charged it works during 12 hours of music , movie and gaming .
buy or not
there is no doubt that this wireless headphone provides a very strong base .
apart from this , its build quality is quite good .
this headphone was launched for rs 4,499 .
but , on many online sites you can buy it for a low price i.e. rs 3,149 .

the whole month of may was full of new device launches .
while google brought its pixel phone .
on the other hand , a big device like oneplus was also launched in india this month .
meanwhile , nokia also introduced two models in the mid-range in india .
the company launched nokia 4.2 and nokia 3.2 .
both phones came to us for review and today we have published a review of 4.2.
earlier nokia had launched phones up to 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 series but this is the first time the company has launched any model in 4 series .
therefore , this device was also very important .
however , during the review , we have focused on the performance and quality of the phone , not the series .
it has also been tested whether it is capable of competing with giants like xiaomi and samsung or has only come up with the name of nokia .
nokia style
seeing the style and built quality of nokia 4.2 , you can say that this phone is not less than anyone .
the back panel of the phone is of glass whose quality is very good .
in the rear panel , the camera setup has been given in the style of nokia phone in the middle towards the top .
two cameras one by one and flash under it .
there is a fingerprint scanner at the bottom .
where today gradient design companies are using more .
on the other hand , you will get dark glass finish in most nokia phones and we liked it much better .

phone has a 3.5 mm audio jack in the upper panel , volume rocker and power button will be found in the right panel while sim slot on the left side . and the google assistant button has been given .
overall , the design can be said to be very good , the company has introduced it with a smaller screen and because of this it seems more compact .
easily it will come in your palm and pocket .
the drawback can be said that fingerprints in the back panel are high .
nokia 4.2 has a 5.7-inch tft lcd display with 19 : 9 aspect ratio .
the screen resolution of the phone is hd + ( 720 × 1520 ) and it uses 2.5d curved glass .
at the same time , the phone has the asai dragon trail coating which protects it from minor scratches .
you will see water drop in the phone .
however , you can find a decrease in the display that phones in this range have full hd display resolutions today and the screen is small .
but if you look at the display , the lack of full hd will not be much .
yes , it sounds a bit dull but some full hd phones have a similar feeling .
touch feeling is great and you will enjoy it too .
today , the display may seem small in the trend of big screens , but for those who like compact phones , it is absolutely accurate .
especially i loved it .
we saw this kind of size in the galaxy s10e recently .
low specification
nokia has been launching its phones in india for the last two years and with every device people complain that i wish its processor would have been better .
you will say the same for nokia 4.2 .
this phone has been introduced on qualco mm snapdragon 439 processor .
the phone has a 2.0 ghz clock speed octaqor ( 2 × 2.0 ghz cortex-a53 &amp; 6 × 1.45 ghz cortex a53 ) processor with 12 nanometer fabrication .
today snapdragon 600 series processors are available in this range , in this case it can be called a little back .
yes , this time you will not complain much about ram and rom , in the indian market , this phone is available in 3 gb ram and 32 gb memory .
along with this , memory card support has also been provided .
talking about performance , this phone is good , it cannot be said to be very good in terms of budget .
in this , you will be able to play games like pubg only on low graphics .
at the same time , in ordinary gaming , you will see a frame drop .
however , we did not see any problem in dealing with daily tasks .
at the same time , multi-tasking etc. was also doing better .
in this case , nokia 4.2 will be called quite good .
this phone comes with android one integration and you will be able to feel pure android .
its ui is very clean and very easy to use .
google apps will be available in this but other apps are not .
in this case , you can download the required apps from yourself .
google assistant button is given in the phone , but with the button on the other side , it will take time for its usage to begin .
in nokia 4.2 , the company has given a dual rear camera with a 13-mp sensor and it comes with f / 2.2 aperture .
the second sensor is given 2-mp .
this sensor is for the depth effect .
the phone also has pdaf support , which is known for fast focus .
it is good about picture quality .
but we were hoping for better from nokia phones .
at the same time , you will also see the effect of its slow processor in the camera .
the picture quality was good in the good light of the phone , but it did not prove to be very effective when the light was low .
yes , the bokeh effect of the phone is quite good .
the phone has an 8-mp selfie camera which comes with f / 2.0 aperture .
हालांकि यहां पर भी आपको बेहतर परिणाम नहीं मिलेगा ।
even in selfie , it does not impress you , but the depth effect will definitely impress you .
nokia 4.2 has three slots where you can use microsd card with two sims .
the phone has 4g volte support .
along with this , wifi and bluetooth have also been provided .
the company has given micro usb 2.0 in it .
for security , face unlock has been provided with pin , pattern , password and fingerprint scanner .
the phone &apos;s face unlock is good .
yes , not very fast but does the right thing .
for power backup , this phone has a battery of 3,000 mah .
although today a large battery is in operation , in this case it will look very low but battery backup is good .
even after good use , it ejects comfortably throughout the day .
in our video test it lasted for about 14 hours 30 minutes .
many phones last up to 4,000 mah battery .
nokia 4.2 is priced at rs 10,990 in the indian market .
according to the price , the specifications seem a little weak .
the phone &apos;s camera is mediocre and the performance will also be seen in a little lag .
yes , you will definitely like pure android .
looks and battery backup are also fine .
no , there are many reasons for shopping , but if you are shopping , the name and compact look of nokia can become .
xiaomi has today introduced the redmi note 7s in the indian market .
this phone is a device between redmi note 7 and redmi note 7 pro launched in february .
the company has introduced it in 2 models where its initial price is rs 10,999 .
at the same time , a price of rs 12,999 has been set for the second model .
the specifications of the phone are good , as well , the company has introduced it with a strong camera feature .
in such a situation , you will also want to know that taking redmi note 7 in this budget is best or take a little money and take redmi note 7s only .
with the launch , this phone became available to us .
in such a situation , we have not reviewed yet , but have presented the first glimpse of it , so that you can guess a lot about this phone .
xiaomi redmi note 7s is made of body glass which is quite shiny .
this phone is very smart to watch but it is not that the design is unique .
to a large extent , it looks like xiaomi &apos;s other phone .
especially the redmi note 7 pro .
you will find this redmi note 7 pro key in both front and back .
however the design is compact and quality is good .
yes , because of the shiny body , the fingerprints were quite high .

the display quality is good and the touch feel is also better .
this phone works on android operating system 9 pie .

although similar to other mi phones in use .
in this you will find a menu on the home screen itself , which you can see by swiping .

this phone will be available for sale from may 23 on the online store flipkart and the company &apos;s website .
overall , the phone is very good .
yes , the question is definitely whether it would be better to take the redmi 7s except the redmi note 7 , then according to me it would be better .
you have to pay about 1,000 rupees more and you will have a strong camera .
samsung launched the new a series phones this year with the galaxy a50 and galaxy a30 .
after this , the company launched the galaxy a10 and a20 and now the fifth phone in this series has been brought with samsung galaxy a70 , which is currently the most expensive phone in the a series .
in the indian market , the price of galaxy a70 starts at rs 28,990 and it is available for sale at the store from may 1 .
samsung &apos;s phone should not be discussed can it ever happen ?
no ! this time too , there is a lot of noise about the new galaxy .
people are also comparing it to the vivo v15 pro with triple camera and bigger battery .
when this device came to us for review , we also tested it after taking care of these things .
super fast charging ,
although every time we start with the design but would like to mention this special things first .
first of all , let me say that samsung galaxy a70 is the first phone of the company which has 25 watt fast charging support .
earlier the company introduced the 25 w charger in the galaxy s10 5g but it is currently available only in korea whereas the a70 has been launched globally by the company .
this phone has a large battery of 4,500 mah .
as far as charging is concerned , it is much faster than before .
this phone becomes fully charged in about 50 minutes .
although we tested it with the charger of the opo and huawei phones , it is still a bit behind in that case .
the battery backup of the phone is superb and once fully charged , it easily lasts a full day even after heavy usage .
if you use an average it can last from one and a half to two days .
in terms of battery , it surpasses the vivo v15 pro .
samsung galaxy a70 has been introduced by the company with a 6.7-inch screen .
this is the first phone in the a series to have such a big screen .
this phone is available with 19.5 : 9 aspect ratios and the company has used super amoled screen .
the company has introduced it with the water drop notch display .
the bezels on the phone are quite low .
even at the bottom you will get a very low bezel .
in such a situation , despite the big screen , the phone does not look big .
the company has used 2.5d curved glass .
the screen is corning gorilla glass protected , which protects it from minor scratches .
after looking at the screen of the phone , you can say that it is difficult to match the display of samsung .
if the palm is small then you have to use it with both hands .
on the other hand , we can say the good thing that the feeling of video and gaming in it will be very spectacular .
at the same time , super amoled screen brings more spark in it .

attractive design
samsung galaxy a70 has been introduced by the company in a glass body .
the build quality of the phone is superb .
like other phones of the company , its corners are quite curved .
yes , it is a good thing that it is very smooth .
in such a situation , it will make you feel better to hold the phone .
hardware buttons are given on the right panel in the phone while there is a sim slot on the left panel .
the bottom has usb , 3.5 mm audio jack , and loudspeaker .
due to the big screen , the phone seems a bit big but you will also be a little surprised that despite its 4,500 mah battery , it will not look too heavy .
it weighs just 183 grams .
the software and hardware
galaxy a70 is introduced on android 9 pie and it works on samsung &apos;s oneui 1.1 .
all the phones recently launched by samsung are available with this ui and the feel is almost the same .
icons are large which makes it easy to use .
although many people do not like such large icons , in such a setting , the size can be changed .
apart from this , an option to change the grid has also been given .
some good options will be found in the phone like blue light filter and secure folder .
apart from this , there is also night mode .
however where earlier samsung phones for bixby had a separate hardware button .
at the same time , the company has removed it .
however , if you wish , you can set it to the power button .
apart from the google apps of the phone , other samsung apps will also be found .
yes , samsung pay is also integrated into it .
this is the first phone of the a series in which this feature is available .
you can enable your credit and debit card in it and payment can be made by simply tapping through nfc .
samsung galaxy a70 has been introduced by the company on snapdragon 675 chipset .
the recently launched vivo v15 pro is also available on the same processor .
the phone has a 2.2 ghz octacore processor ( 2 × 2 ghz cryo 460 gold and 6 × 1.7 ghz cryo 460 silver ) .
the company has introduced it in 6 gb ram and 128 gb memory .
although ram space is available around 3.5 gb while 102 gb of storage is available .
if you talk about performance , then you will not have any problem .
this phone is able to handle all the tasks easily .
in the phone , you can play games like pubg in high definition mode .
the graphics are very good and good display is also fun .
yes , due to the slow animation of samsung , it will feel a little slow at times but it is very good in performance .
during the experiment , we played a lot of games and also did multi tasking but no problem was found anywhere .
slow motion camera there
is a lot of discussion about the samsung galaxy a70 camera .
especially selfie .
in the back panel of this phone , you will see triple rear camera setup .
the main camera of the phone is 32-megapixels and it comes with f / 1.7 aperture .
you will get the benefit of large aperture to watch in low light at night .
apart from this , the phone also has pdaf support .
the secondary camera of the phone is 8-mp and it is f / 2.2 aperture .
it is given for wide angle photography .
with the camera , you will get features such as live focus , wide angle and pro mode .
at the same time , it also has ai integration which adjusts the color tone according to the scene .
where you can adjust blur before photography in live focus , after photography , the option to change the effect on one touch has been given .
these effects are very spectacular .
at the same time , wide angle mode will also be preferred .
so far we have not seen such a wide angle in the phones of other companies .
talking about the video , first of all , let me tell that the company has provided super slow motion video along with slow motion in it , which is quite spectacular .
although you cannot shoot a very long video , it will be a fun feeling in a few seconds .
the phone has 4k video record support and you can enjoy it by going to settings .
talking about the picture quality of the phone is fantastic and the video will also impress you .
however , vivo &apos;s v15 pro also comes in the same range and is also of almost the same specification .
when we compared the pictures of both the phones , in some cases it came forward .
although color tone and light were good in samsung , vivo was taking pictures in more detail .
but during low light , samsung &apos;s picture got better .
at the same time , vivo will not get ultra slow motion and such wide angle mode .
the company has introduced the samsung galaxy a70 with a 32-mp selfie camera .
there are not many options with the front camera but live focus and wide angle support will be available .
with the front camera , you can record full hd video .
speaking of quality , it is capable of leaving any phone behind in this budget .
the quality of the front camera is quite good and you can shoot selfies even at night .
its quality is better than vivo v15 pro .
but remember that vivo has a pop up selfie camera .
connectivity and security is
samsung galaxy a70 dual sim support .
along with this , there is also 3g , 4g and wifi for data .
the company has also equipped it with nfc features .
turning to security , you will get face unlock and in-display fingerprint scanner with simple pin password .
this phone has an optical fingerprint scanner .
the phone &apos;s fingerprint unlock is a bit slow .
although it gets a bit faster while using it , but still there is some slow .
face unlock has become faster than the previous samsung phones and we liked it too .
it would also be better to have usb type c.
after considering all the aspects of the samsung galaxy a70 , when it comes to the conclusion , it can be said that it is a good phone .
solid built quality , excellent camera , large battery , fast charging and smart display are the reasons for taking a phone .
yes ! mentioning the shortfall , it can be said that it would have been better if a little cheaper .
at the same time , performance is not such that it can prove to be the best in its category .
but also keep in mind that it is available at offline stores .
at the same time the company after sales service is very good .
in such a situation , you can buy this phone , you will not get disappointed .
today , in the budget of 25 thousand to 30 thousand , the options are very low , in such a situation , the galaxy a70 gives users a good option .
this is the first time google has introduced four models in a year .
the company introduced pixel 3 and pixel 3 xl in september last year .
at the same time , the same small models of pixel 3a and pixel 3a xl have been launched .
although it was launched in mountview , california , the company has given information about its sale date and price in india as well .
these phones will be available for sale on online store flipkart from may 15 , where their initial price will be rs 39,999 .
as is known , the pixel 3 and 3xl launched by google is now called the best camera phone .
in such a situation , even though the price of the new pixel 3a and 3a xl may be low , the expectations of the people are the same .
with the launch , this phone was also available for review from us and we also tried to know whether the camera of this phone is also the best or an ordinary phone that has just been launched with the name of google ?
google pixel 3a and pixel 3a xl are not new in terms of design .
the body of the phone is made of plastic and looks the same as the old pixels .
yes , some people have complaints with polycarbonate plastic but we have no complaints .
quality is good and gives better grip .
the phone does not slip quickly by hand .
at the same time , the size of the pixel 3a was also very good .
you can use the phone with one hand .
its dimensions are 151.3 × 70.1 × 8.2 millimeters and weigh 147 grams .
the xl model seems slightly larger .
although we do not have much complaint with the height , rather the width would have been better if it was a little less .
yes , the hardware buttons on the side must have seemed a bit odd .
overall , in today &apos;s phones , where the use of glossy panel and glass looks more shiny , it will give a strong and gentle feeling .
also read : first glimpse of realme 3 pro : see how great this phone is in the
pixel 3a 5.6-inch full-hd + ( 1080 × 2220 pixels ) goled display .
the pixel 3a xl has a 6.0-inch ( 1080 x 2160 pixels ) screen .
the company has introduced it with 18 : 9 aspect ratios .
however , about two years ago , the nokia phone was launched and today the flower view and bezel lace phones are available in the budget up to 5,000 .
but in the pixel phone you will see thicker bezel .
this will be called a slight decrease in the display .
otherwise the display is very good when it comes to quality .
at the same time , touch response is also excellent .
it has been coated with dragon trail to protect the screen .
hardware / software
google has introduced google pixel 3a and pixel 3a xl in cheap price .
as such , the company has tied up with hardware .
these phones operate qualco mm snapdragon 670 processor .
the phone has an octacore processor ( 2 × 2.0 ghz 360 gold + 6 × 1.7 ghz cryo 360 silver ) .
in the mid-range it is considered a good processor .
but in the budget of rs 40,000 , you can say a little back .
at the same time , pixel 3a and pixel 3a xl handsets have the same variants of 4 gb ram and 64 gb storage .
the phone does not have memory card support .
now talking about performance , there are quite a few phones available in this range .
it lags behind them by a small margin .
but can &apos;t say much back .
the most important thing is that we could not see the leg anywhere and the response was very smooth .
yes , it cannot be called the best in terms of gaming .
however , the reason is also stock android .
you will enjoy using the phone .
clean ui and excellent touch response enhance the usefulness of this phone .
as you know , this is google &apos;s phone which runs on the latest android .
the company has introduced it on android 9 pie and will continue to get updates for a few years .
the stock android gesture is something else .
if you swipe the finger up and down , then the resent app also opens with the app dropper .
if you take it to the top , then the menu comes up , and if you keep it in half , the hirsant app will appear .
some small tweaks like this make it more fun .
like the previous pixels , it also has a squiz feature .
where google assistant comes out on pressing the body of the phone .
this feature is very fun and also com in off screen .
as we have talked about earlier .
pixel phones are especially in the discussion due to their camera quality and something similar is being expected about these phones .
in such a situation , after seeing the picture quality , it can be said that it is able to live up to your expectations .
google pixel 3a and pixel 3a xl for photography have a 12.2-megapixel dual-pixel sony imx 363 sensor on the rear .
it is equipped with optical image stabilization , electronic stabilization and f / 1.8 aperture .
in addition , both smartphones of the pixel 3a series support the night-site low-light photography feature .
at the same time , google has given an 8-megapixel sensor with f / 2.0 aperture on the front for selfie and video calling in both phones .
regardless of the condition , its picture quality will get you the best .
this is the best camera phone in this range .
even the selfie will surprise you with its quality .
battery and connectivity the
company has given 3,000 mah battery in pixel 3a , which has been claimed that it will give 12 hours of video playback time .
at the same time , the pixel 3a xl has a battery of 3,700 mah .
the company has decided to provide powerful chargers with these phones .
in terms of battery , 3a can be said a bit backwards , but the performance is good and removes comfort one day .
at the same time , the battery backup of the pixel 3a xl is excellent .
talking about the connectivity feature, both phones have options such as 4g volte, wi-fi 802.11 ac, bluetooth 5.0, gps / a-gps, nfc, 3.5 mm headphone jack.
this can be said to be a good thing .
where it was removed in pixels 3 and 3 axles , the company has brought it back again in these fonts .
according to the user , this can be said to be a good thing .
google pixel 3a is priced at rs 39,999 .
at the same time , the company has introduced the pixel 3a axle for rs 44,999 .
if you compare the specification , then the price will be slightly higher .
but after using it for a few days , i liked this phone very much .
the phone will look better as you use it .
the camera is amazing , as well as its smooth ui also makes it the best .
not only this , if you want to take the expensive pixel 3 and pixel 3 xl just because of the camera , then it would be better to choose 3a or 3a axles instead .
yes , if you like gaming more then this phone is probably not for you .
in today &apos;s time , almost every person using a smartphone is troubled by the tangle of wired earphones or headphones .
how many we try , but sometimes the wires of the earphones and headphones kept in the bag or pocket get tangled .
at the same time , it often takes a lot of time to resolve these wires .
but , if you have been troubled by wired earphones and headphones like me , then there are many wireless ear phones and headphones in the market .
but , now trend true wireless earbuds are going on in the market .
samsung , nokia and apple have introduced their true wireless earbuds in the market .
on the other hand , skullcandy is also giving customers another option in the market with its true wireless earbuds .
the company launched its skullcandy push earbudle in the indian market some time ago , priced at rs 9,999 .
when we got a chance to use skullcandy push , we tried to know if this market will be able to compete with samsung galaxy buds and nokia true wireless earphones .
because it is not at all lower in price .
in such a situation , if users choose them , it was important to know the answer as well .
design and specifications
if you talk about the design of skullcandy push , then it will not attract you much , which we expect from a true wireless earbuds .
however , it is mediocre at not doing too poorly .
once used , you will get used to its design .
both the earbuds have separate buttons that provide power on-off and volume control .
the push case is a bit bigger , but it can easily come in your pocket .
a small led light indicator is present in the case , which will give you battery information .
there is a type-c charging port on the right side of the case .
along with the led light indicator , you will see a button , by pressing it you can get information about its battery .
comfort
if compared to the case in the case of samsung buds either case skullcandy push slightly larger , which seems strange to be kept in your pocket .
with this , earphones will come out of the ear separately when you use push .
this does not mean that earbuds are incompatible .
you can enjoy it even after it fits well in the ear .
also its good thing is that push is quite lightweight .
if you use them even while traveling , then you do not have any problem .
even after wearing it for a long time , your ears will not feel any pain or feel awkward .
i used it while traveling in a crowded metro .
however , in the meantime , when another passenger was caught , it came out and fell down .
its fitting is not as good as that of samsung or apple .
if you want to use them during a workout or running , then my advice would be to not use it .
however , it can be used while sitting or walking on the road .
push has been introduced by the company with auto power on and auto power off , which means that it will turn on as soon as it is taken out of the case and it will turn off when put in the case .
talking about its sound quality , we heard its music with different apps .
it performed well with the gaana app and google music .
buds offer good sound quality in terms of mid , vocal , base .
however , push is far ahead in terms of base .
after listening to different apps and different songs , we can say that its sound quality is quite strong .
however , its noise cancellation is not so good .
but , still the outside sound reaches your ears much less .
in this
way , there are buttons on the side of both earbuds , using which you can do many things .
music can be played or paused with a single tap .
however , you may have trouble connecting it to your phone initially .
but , for this , we tell you how to connect this skullcandy push to your phone for the first time .
after removing both your buds from the case , the left bud will have to be tapped for about 7 seconds .
after this , the name of push will appear on bluetooth in your phone and you can connect it to the phone .
with this , they can be turned off by pressing the left bud button for 5 seconds .
at the same time , to increase the volume , the right bud button has to be tapped twice and to reduce the volume the left button has to be tapped twice .
at the same time , the right bud button will have to be pressed for three seconds to play the next song .
if you want to receive / end the call on earbuds , for this you have to tap on the left bud .
battery case .
once charged , you will be able to fully charge push earbuds 2 times .
how is its battery backup , it cannot be told completely because whenever you do not use it , keep the buds in the case and they will be charged .
but for 2-3 hours of use throughout the day , it lasts for about 2 days .
it takes about 1 hour for the case to be fully charged .
overall , the performance is correct but due to design and price it lags behind .
if you are using wireless earphones then you will definitely want to use it during congestion or exercise and this is where it bothers .
also the price is very high .
in such a situation , my advice would be not to take it .
it was heard last year that samsung is going to change in 2019 .
at the beginning of this year , the company also made it realize .
the company introduced the galaxy m series and the new a series in the mid-range , which were not only different in feature but also in looks and price as compared to samsung &apos;s old phone lineup .
now it was the turn to see the flagships and in february the company launched the samsung galaxy s10 series .
last year we reviewed samsung galaxy s9 + , in such a situation it was very curious for us to see the new phones of samsung galaxy s10 series .
although at first glance , we were trying to know how much has changed and then we started the review .
but when i saw the phone , it was realized that yes , samsung has indeed changed .
although the review of the phone in april after launching on february 20 can be said to be a bit old , but it is also necessary to mention here that the company launches the s series only once a year and there is talk of the phone throughout the year .
that is why a review is made .
let &apos;s start with the review …
when the samsung galaxy s10 came to us , there were some other people with me at that time and we quickly opened the box .
wow came out of everyone &apos;s mouth after seeing the phone .
this was the biggest achievement of this phone .
the phone design is completely different from the old galaxy s8 or s9 and is quite sleek .
the biggest thing that happened is that it is quite compact even after the big screen .
we have not yet seen such a compact phone in this size screen .
its thickness is only 7.8  mm while the s9 had a thickness of 8.5  mm .
the company has used a curved display in it but due to being slick , the curves are less visible than before .
the advantage of this is that there is no longer a palm touch on the side screen repeatedly and you will be able to use the phone easily .
first glimpse of realme 3 pro : see how great this phone has
been in terms of built quality , so samsung &apos;s s series gives a premium feel from the beginning and has become better this time . samsung galaxy s10 &apos;s backpanel is made of glass while the company has it is introduced on a metal frame .
on the right is the power button while on the left is the volume and the company &apos;s vice assistant bixby button .
there is a sim slot at the top and 3.5 mm audio jack at the bottom , usb type-c and loudspeaker grill .
the glass panel feels quite fragile and can break easily .
however , the company has given a cover with a sales pack , which can be said to be a good thing .
samsung galaxy m20 review : all-rounder performance and strong battery makes it move
towards the special front panel , the company has given a bezel less punch hole display .
however , it has been named infiniti o by samsung .
the selfie camera is available in this hole on the right .
at the same time , you will see the earpiece in the middle of the phone .
the rear panel has a flash and heart rate sensor with three cameras inside the imported design .
overall , the design is amazing and you will definitely like it .
if there is a lack of talk , one can be said that the 3.5 mm audio jack is given at the bottom , so if you are playing a game with earphones , then it seems in the hands and the control buttons are there .
you may have some problems here .
honor view 20 review : oneplus
6t gives tough competition
display , even in the best
its screen to body ratio is 88.3 percent .
the company has introduced it with 19.5 : 9 aspect ratios and its screen resolution is 1440 x 3040 pixels .
the screen of the phone is gorilla glass 6 coated which prevents minor scratches and strengthens the screen .
gorilla glass 6 is corning &apos;s newest screen protection technology .
at the same time , it can be said that this phone has hdr 10 + support , in such a way , the colors and display on the display will look absolutely real .
the most important thing in the display was that the punch hole appears empty but it responds to the touch .
it uses when you are accessing or sliding the quick menu .
where most phones have a selfie on the left side .
in the s10 , it is on the punch hole notch display on the right and top .
although we felt a bit different in the beginning , but later realized that the place where there is a punch hole does not get many things , in such a situation that the hole does not spoil the display .
the phone &apos;s display is excellent and the touch response is equally good .
the company has used dynamic amoled panels and you will realize this during use .
you are in the room then in bright sunlight .
there will be no trouble anywhere .
at the same time , its always on display will also impress you .
it is not always on .
but as soon as you touch the screen even a little bit becomes on .
as is known , samsung galaxy s10 has these display fingerprint scanners .
the company has used an ultrasonic in display fingerprint scanner with qualco mm technology .
the phone &apos;s display fingerprint scanner is good but cannot be said to be very fast .
earlier we used optic in display fingerprint scan in oneplus 6t which is much faster .
at the same time , samsung galaxy s10e has a fingerprint scan on the side panel , it is also very fast .
despite this , you will not have trouble .
you can set these display fingerprint scanners to always on display .
at the same time , i had already used devices like galaxy note 9 and s9 plus where the part below the screen of the phone was clickable and we noticed the lack of this feature .
although it has an erase to wakeup , the clickable screen experience was quite good .
samsung galaxy s10
is a new realization of the software the company has introduced on the android operating system 9 pie .
in this , you will get to see the new one ui of the company .
the company has made the ui quite light , in such a situation where there was a complaint of getting stuck in touchwiz and samsung experience , there was nothing like it .
by this , the default icons are kept slightly larger .
because of this it is easy to use but many people may have some complaints .
in such an option , you can go to the home screen settings and make changes .
at the same time , like the note phone , there is an option to rotate the home screen .
along with this , the company has also given the option of screen gestures instead of navigation bars .
its option will be found in the navigation bar inside the display .
when you turn it on , the navigation buttons are removed from the screen and instead of this , three times you will see those who do the work of navigation .
not only this , if you wish , you can also change the placement of these buttons , its option is available here .
like other flagship phones of samsung , it also has an integration of vice assistant bixby but i am not much of a bixby fan myself but was impressed with the bixby routine .
in this , you direct the task and at that time it automatically activates the apps in the phone .
in this way you can set your routine from morning to night .
today connected devices are in practice .
tv , fridge , ac , ro and bulbs are connected to the internet .
in such a situation , the company gave an app called smartthings which itself scanned and connected bluetooth and wifi based devices .
on the other hand , options such as kids home and bluelight filters are also very beneficial for you .
performance is also no less
as it is seen every time samsung launches its flagship phone with two processors .
this is also the case this time .
one model is on the snapdragon 855 which is available for the us .
at the same time , the model of galaxy s10 made available in other countries including india runs on the exynos 9820 chipset , which is samsung &apos;s own processor .
in it , you will see an octa-core processor ( 2 × 2.73 ghz möngüz m4 + 2 × 2.31 ghz cortex-a75 + 4 × 1.95 ghz cortex-a55 ) .
along with this , mali-g76 mp12-emea processor will be seen for graphics .
the company has introduced samsung galaxy s10 with 128 gb / 512 gb memory with 8 gb of ram .
along with this , the phone has memory card support and you can use cards up to 512 gb .
although the second slot is hybrid , only one of the cards or sim can be used .
it is good to see that out of 8 gb , only about 2.5 gb of ram is used and you get 5.5 gb of ram free .
speaking of memory , about 25 gb out of 128 gb goes into the system file and os and you get 103 gb free .
talking about performance , the processing is very smooth and you will also feel that it is flagship .
yes , initially a couple of apps crashed but after the update it started working again .
आप एक साथ कितने भी ऐप क ् यों न खोल लें लेकिन इसे कोई फर ् क नहीं पड ़ ा ।
yes , it seems a bit slower than oneplus to open the app but the reason may be one ui animations .
otherwise there will be no complaint in performance .
camera : better but the pixels are still
triple camera setup has been given in the rear panel of the best samsung galaxy s10 .
the main camera is 12-megapixels and supports f / 1.5-2.4 variable aperture .
we have seen this before in the galaxy s10 plus and galaxy note 9 .
the main sensor has dual pixel pdaf and ois support .
at the same time , its second sensor is 12-megapixels and the company has introduced it with f / 2.4 aperture .
this sensor is telephoto and also supports 2x optical zoom and ois with autofocus .
the third sensor of the phone comes with f / 2.2 aperture and it works for wide angle .
apart from the pro and panorama modes with the camera , wide angle support has been provided .
the best thing can be said that this phone also has a wide angle mode in video , which is seen in very few phones .
at the same time , ultra slow motion is also given in the video with slow motion .
for video , it is capable of recording 4k recordings at 60 frames .
talking about camera quality , there are no two opinions about it , it is very good .
at the same time , its experience gets even better in the brilliant display .
it is also not possible to deny that it enhances the photo excessively , especially the face .
on the other hand , if you are taking a picture of something , then it will not be a problem .
it is capable of taking better photos in every condition .
however , complaints have been received about its low light in many places .
but we did not have any such problem .
especially in the night , we shot many videos and got very good results .
the bokeh effect in the phone is also great .
you can edit the background before or after taking a photo .
you will also like ultra slow motion and wide angle .
although you get very little time in ultra slow motion , the effect is quite amazing .
the phone has auto hdr support and in more or less light it automatically adjusts the picture .
yes , if you compare the picture of samsung galaxy s10 with google pixel 3 , then it is definitely left behind there .
talking about selfie , the company has equipped it with a 10 mp camera and it comes with f / 1.9 aperture .
the company has introduced it with autofocus and pdaf support .
at the same time , it is capable of recording 2k videos at 30 frames per second .
its photo and video quality is very good but it also enhances the photo more than necessary .
yes , it can be said that it works quite well in low light .
new-age security
samsung galaxy s10 has dual 4g support .
in addition , wifi , bluetooth and nfc will also be available .
the special thing can be said that many features are associated with nfc .
you can use samsung pay in the phone as well , it also comes in handy for reverse charging .
the earbuds launched by the company are charged as soon as they are placed on it .
talking about security , it has a simple pattern , face unlock in addition to password , and an in-display fingerprint scanner .
the company has used qualco mm &apos;s ultrasonic fingerprint scanner which is much talked about .
although we felt a little slow .
earlier , many other companies including oneplus , oppo and vivo had used these display fingerprint scanners which are quite fast .
battery power is slightly less than the
this phone is almost fully charged in one and a half hours .
power backup , the phone has a battery of 3,400 mah .
the company has introduced usb type c and will get a 15 watt fast charger with sales pack .
at the same time , it has fast charging support even during wireless charging , it can be said to be a good thing .
हां बैटरी बैकअप थोड ़ ा और बेहतर होता तो ज ् यादा अच ् छा कहा जाता ।
once fully charged , the average only takes out a full day even after use .
in heavy use , you have to charge twice .
after watching all the segments , it comes to see if it is worth shopping .
so let me tell you that the price of samsung galaxy s10 in the indian market starts from rs 66,900 .
this budget is very big and you will want the best phone in it .
you will love its premium design , great performance and better display .
on taking the phone , you will realize that yes it is an expensive phone .
you could expect better from the camera but wide angle and slow motion is the best .
in such a situation , it can be said that you can take s10 .
realme 3 was launched in india in march and at the same time the company had informed that another variant of it will be introduced soon .
although the company did not mention the name , but since then realme 3 pro was being discussed .
today , this phone has been launched in india .
the initial price of this phone in the indian market is rs 13,999 and it will also be available for sale from april 29 .
with the launch , this phone became available to us and we have come to you with its first glimpse .
if you are planning to buy reality 3 pro , then do check it out once .
the first glimpse of the phone is able to tell you a lot .
realme 3 pro is very stylish to look at but will not get newness in terms of look .
the oppo f11 looks similar to the pro or realme 3 .
the company has introduced it in a glass finish body and is available in gradian design .
yes , the back panel has a pattern design from the inside which brings a bit of newness .

moving downwards , there is a loudspeaker and 3.5 mm audio jack with micro usb slot .
the build quality is good and despite the shiny body , the slip is low .
yes kami can say that the fingerprint marks are quite high on the previous panel , but the company has provided cover with the sales pack .
realme 3 pro has a 6.3-inch screen that supports fullhd + pixel resolution .
its aspect ratio is 19 : 9 , while the screen is gorilla glass 6 coated .
the display is good and we also liked the touch .
this phone works on qualco mm &apos;s snapdragon 710 chipset with 10 nanometer fabrication and has a 2.2 ghz octa-core processor .
along with this is the adreno 616 gpu , which is known for better graphics realization .
however , we have only used it a little bit and it was working well .
the phone was easily handling a game like pubg .
yes , we cannot say much about performance right now .
memory
realme 3 pro has been introduced by the company in 2 memory variants .
one of its models comes with 6 gb ram and it has 128 gb of internal storage .
at the same time , 64 gb internal memory has been given in the second variant with 4 gb ram .
both models have expandable memory support and you can use cards up to 256 gb .
the company has introduced realme 3 pro on android 9 pie , the latest os of android , which is based on coloros 6.0 .
in such a situation , you will feel something different than a phone with ordinary stock android .
there is a menu on the home screen itself and can be seen by swiping it .
good thing can be said that these preloaded apps will not be seen .
this phone is very special in terms of camera and has the power to give tough competition to anyone in this budget .
reality 3 pro has a 25-megapixel selfie camera , which is equipped with ai beauty filters .
the back panel is a dual rear camera in which one sensor is 16-megapixels while the other is 5-megapixels .
this camera setup supports boca effect as well as super slow motion video recording .
at the same time , the company has equipped it with pixel binning feature where the main camera is capable of taking pictures at a pixel resolution of 64 mp .
as for the camera quality , we have only used it for some time .
in such a situation , the feeling of selfie was good .
but the real camera has impressed a lot .
more details about this will be given later but initial results were very good .
in addition to the phone unit with a sales pack , the phone has power adapter , usb cable , sim ejector tool and cover .
the reality 3 pro &apos;s 4 gb variant costs rs 13,999 .
the 6 gb model will be available for rs 16,999 .
these phones can be purchased from the official offline retailers of ecommerce site flipkart and reality .
you will also like to listen to the song on the earphone from mobile but it sounds good only when you are alone .
but when friends meet and the mood of the party is formed then who listens on earphones .
some banging music is needed , on which everyone will dance .
although there are many music players , they are known for very good sound .
but some of them are very big and some cost very much .
the device is very small and powerful .
realizing this need , mobile accessories brand tag has launched a portable bluetooth speaker called flex .
the company claims that this small speaker can make your party look great .
the price of this music player is rs 1,749 and this device was also available to us for review and we used this device for almost a month and the conclusion is in front of you .
first of all , let &apos;s talk about design .
tag flex is a smart device whose built quality is quite solid .
the rest of the body is of polycarbonate with a rubber coating .
the advantage is that it does not slip quickly by hand .
at the same time it has two rubber cutouts at the bottom which gives it a good grip .
good thing can be said that even on a smooth surface , the sound does not move even if it is loud .
and it also prevents the bottom surface from being scratched .

in the rear panel of the device , you are given a power button , tft card slot and micro usb slot .
at the same time , control buttons will be seen in the upper panel .
the design of the device is good but we liked its size very much .
you can move it around with your hand and there will be no problem .
even if you keep the weight for a long time , there will not be trouble .

when it comes out of features , aside from the special design , then let me know that the company has given two 3 watt speakers in it .
in addition , this device supports bluetooth 4.0 .
you can connect it to your phone up to a range of 10 meters .
a 1,200 mah battery is provided for power backup and the company claims that it is capable of providing up to 4 hours of play time .
if you talk about charging , then it gets fully charged in about two hours time .

the button to change the mode is in the upper panel .
let me tell you that it also has calling support where you can connect to the phone and make a conference call from it .
the phone has tft card support , so the button has been given at the top to change the mode .
talking about performance , you can say in one sentence that you will like this device a lot .
the design is excellent in this as well as the music quality is also very good .
the sound of this small device is so sharp that in a large room you can easily enjoy the dj .
on the other hand , if you are going to have some fun outdoors , then it will also work for you .
its sound is quite sharp and you can listen comfortably even in a radius of 25 meters .
yes , a slight drawback here can be said that the sound in full sound bursts a bit .
despite this , you will like its sound quality .
during the use of tag flax , we connected it to many different phones and it was able to pair easily .
we did not face any kind of problem .
at the same time , it has an additional feature of having a calling button .
you will get clear sound quality during calling .
it has a reverse and forward button at the top which also works for volume control .
once you press it , the music changes , but to control the volume , you have to press and hold it .
overall , tag flax is a great music player .
yes , if you remove the deficiency then you can say that there is no waterproof , but in this budget you will not get a waterproof device either .
for those users who want to use the smartphone but cannot spend much , google brought the android go version .
the biggest feature of android go version is that smartphones equipped with this os are capable of working very smooth despite low ram memory and small internal storage .
only last month , xiaomi launched its android go based smartphone redmi go in the indian market , which was directly competing with nokia &apos;s android go phone nokia 1 .
in terms of price , where the nokia 1 was slightly more expensive than the redmi go , only last week nokia cut the nokia 1 price and made it stand in the competition of redmi go .
if you are also planning to get android go phone and confuse which phone should be taken from nokia 1 and redmi go .
in design and first look , the nokia 1 seems more interactive than xiaomi redmi go .
so further , we have told you the details and specifications of both smartphones , which you will be able to know by reading , is it better to take nokia 1 or xiaomi redmi go .
nokia 1 and xiaomi redmi go both these smartphones have been introduced on the old design , which does not have a bezelless display nor will there be any notch .
while the redmi go is a sky boss , the nokia 1 is curved at all four sides .
the selfie camera and speaker have been given on the body part above the display of both phones and navigation has been given on the lower body part .
the single rear camera setup has been given on the upper left side on the back panel of redmi go and the rear camera setup of nokia 1 is present in the middle on the back panel .
the nokia 1 has been introduced by the company on a 4.5-inch wvga ips fullhd display .
to protect the screen , it has been protected with gorilla glass 3 .
the xiaomi redmi go has a 5.0-inch hd display that supports 720 pixels resolution .
in screen size , redmi go is more than nokia 1 .
nokia 1 has been introduced by the company on 1 gb ram memory .
this phone supports 8 gb of internal storage which can be expanded up to 128 gb via microsd card .
in xiaomi redmi , the company has given 1 gb of ram and this phone also supports 8 gb of internal storage .
the storage of this phone can also increase up to 128 gb via card .
the 5-megapixel rear camera is provided on the back panel of nokia 1 and for selfies this phone supports 2-megapixel front camera .
xiaomi redmi go supports 8-megapixel rear camera and for selfies this phone has a 5-megapixel front camera .
processor and chipset
nokia 1 has been introduced on a quad-core processor with 1.1 ghz clock speed that runs on mediatek &apos;s mt6737m .
xiaomi redmi go works on a qualco mm snapdragon 425 chipset with a quad-core processor clocked at 1.4 ghz .
at the same time , xiaomi redmi go supports 3,000 mah battery for power backup .
nokia 1 was launched by the company for rs 5,499 , but after the recent price cut , the price of this phone has increased to rs 3,999 .
on the other hand , redmi go has been launched by xiaomi at a price of rs 4,499 .
both these phones are available for open cell in the indian market .
in today &apos;s price , nokia 1 is 500 rupees cheaper than xiaomi &apos;s redmi go .
but in terms of specifications , xiaomi redmi go proves to be better than nokia 1 .
the look of nokia 1 is more luxurious than redmi go but in terms of chipset , camera and battery , redmi go surpasses .
in such a situation , if you have the ability to spend 500 rupees more then redmi go will be called a better option than nokia 1 .
after the phone has become smart , the clocks have also become smart now .
although the smartwatch is not new , it has become an old thing , but the change is that now these watches have become available at a much lower price .
recently , watch out has introduced its new smartwatch ut generation 2 ( watch out gen2 black storm smartwatch ) in the indian market .
the price of this smartwatch is rs 5,999 and it is equipped with many features .
this device came to us for review and we tried to know whether the features have been compromised with the price .
so let &apos;s talk about design first .
you will like the watch out gen2 black storm smartwatch design .
available in a round dial , the body of this watch is built on a metal frame .
there is a crown on the side on which a line of red is engraved .
it brings a slight variation in the black body .
this crown power button also serves for screen lock and back .
minutes are written with small white lines on the dial , which makes the clock feel even when the screen is off .
it weighs only 70 grams and after tying it in the wrist will make you feel good .
the company has given black color band with this black dial smartwatch which comes with white stitch .
the leather is very soft and you can roam it for hours and there will be no problem of any kind .
at the same time , the design of the band is also clean and quite good .
the smartwatch has a rear loudspeaker , harrett sensor and magnetic charging pin .
it has an option to erase two wakeups .
overall the design looked good but the quality was slightly lacking .
the edges of the watch are very sharp , which gives a slight prick when touched .
the build quality could have been better there .

display and specification
watch out ut generation 2 in xiaomi redmi 7 and samsung galaxy m10 , the company has introduced 1.22-inch ips display with a screen resolution of 240 × 240 pixels .
the display of the phone is good but cannot say very well .
at the same time , the touch feeling is also average .
there was a lack of smoothness in the display .
by default , it comes with 6 watch faces , but during the purchase , you can go to the watchout website and request for the face of your choice .
most of its watchfaces resemble the samsung galaxy watch .
where the display is turned on as soon as the wrist is up , which can be said to be a good thing .
however , if you want to use it well then download the fandu app on your phone .
based on the mediatek 2502c chipset , this smartwatch has 64 mb of ram memory and 128 mb internal memory .
along with this , 300 mah battery is available .
although memory is not much use , but still less .
you cannot put anything in the watch .
watch out ut generation 2 works on bluetooth 4.0 .
it can be paired with both android and ios os .
in android where it supports devices above 4.3 .
at the same time , only devices above ios 7 can be connected to apple .
at the same time , it also has the option of message and sync .
talking about the features , after connecting it syncs up to the phonebook and the call log .
the special thing can be said that the phone has a dialer and you can dial the direct number from here and can also talk to it .
the sound of the speaker is good and you will have trouble talking .
we liked the pedometer , harrett sensor and sedentary that all these features were working well .
how accurate is the heart rate cannot be said .
it has a vice command feature which the company has named siri on the lines of ios .
on turning it on , it turns on google ok in android phones .
however , when searching in the phone itself , then voice in the smartwatch does not make any sense .
you can listen to the music of the phone with your smartwatch .
but there is also a problem here , you cannot select music .
can only play pause , control the volume and go to different or previous songs .
it also has bluetooth camera control feature .
however we connected it to two phones and both times it failed to capture the photo .
finally , when it comes to battery backup , it can be said that it is simple .
once charged , it barely takes a day .
at the same time , you may also have some problems with its magnetic charger .
because this is not an ordinary charger and you have to carry it everywhere .
we liked the fact that it was fully charged in about half an hour .
overall , the experience of watch out ut generation 2 was very mixed .
there was some flaw with every quality .
the design is good , the built quality is simple , the features are very high , the display average .
for rs 5,999 it can be said to be good but cannot say the best at all .
but you cannot see and differentiate .
in this budget , you can see huame ( xiaomi sub brand ) amazefit beep onix .
last month , vivo introduced the v15 pro in the indian market and today launched the v15 .
however , in a series of phones , where there is often only a difference of memory .
at the same time , both phones are different in every case .
however , let me say that the company has introduced both with pop-up selfies and triple rear cameras , despite this it is quite different .
next we have compared both phones in every segment , so that you can know all the features of both phones .
both phones are exactly alike in viewing .
yes , there may be a slight difference in size due to the screen .
both the phones are made of glass , which has been introduced in bright acrylic design .
on the rear panel you will get to see triple camera setup .
yes there is a difference here .
where the v15 has a fingerprint scanner on the rear panel .
the v15 pro has an in-display fingerprint scanner .
which today can be called a premium feature .

the company has introduced this v15 with 6 gb ram but its internal memory is only 64 gb .
it also has memory card support .
the v15 pro has a 3,700 mah battery for power backup .
this phone supports fast charging .
at the same time , the company has introduced vivo v15 with a 4,000 mah battery and it also supports fast charge .
the v15 is ahead in terms of battery .
both phones are similar in terms of operating system .
they work on the funtouch os 9 which is based on the android operating system 9 pie .
in terms of camera , vivo v15 pro is slightly ahead .
there are three camera sensors on the rear panel of which the main sensor is 48-megapixel ( 12 x 4 ) which comes with f / 1.8 aperture .
the company has used pixel binning technology .
it has a 12-mp sensor capable of taking pictures at 48-mp .
its second sensor is 8-megapixel which is for wide angle and the third sensor is given 5-megapixel .
it performs the function of depth sensing .
the v15 also has three sensors but the main sensor is 24-megapixel ( 12 x 2 ) .
however , the company has also introduced it with f / 1.8 aperture .
the rest of the sensors are the same .
the second sensor is 8-megapixel , which supports wide angle .
its third sensor has been given 5-megapixels and it does the work of depth sensing .
selfie cameras
are similar in terms of vivo v15 pro and v15 selfie .
both phones have a 32-megapixel popup camera that comes with f / 2.0 aperture .
security
as we have already talked about , the v15 pro has an in-display fingerprint scanner while the v15 has a scanner in the rear panel .
apart from this , v15 pro has face unlock while v15 does not have that .
it surprised us a little .
because today even low range phones have face unlock .
the price of vivo v15 pro is rs 28,990 .
at the same time , for v15 you have to pay rs 23,990 .
there is a difference of rs 5,000 in both phones .
if you are thinking of taking one of these phones , then according to me it would be better to have a v15 pro .
last month , vivo introduced the v15 pro in the indian market .
at the same time , we had informed that the company is going to present a small variant of the v15 and today the curtain has been lifted from this phone .
vivo v15 has been launched in the indian market where it is priced at rs 23,990 and this phone will be available for pre-booking from 25 march while this phone will go on sale from 1 april .
with the launch , this phone became available to us and we have come with its first glimpse without delay .
there is no significant difference in design in vivo v15 and v15 pro .
the company has introduced it with a glass back panel which is available in acrylic design .
the back panel is quite shiny and the quality is also good .
there is a fingerprint scanner nearby .
there will be a slight difference in design here .
while the vivo v15 has a rear fingerprint scanner , the v15 pro has an in-display sensor .
talking about the front , the phone is completely bezelless .
there is a pop-up camera for the selfie .
overall the design is good and you will like it too .
yes , the screen is slightly raised from the body in such a way that sometimes it is in the palm .

vivo v15 has a 6.53-inch full hd + ( 1080 x 2316 pixels resolution ) screen .
the company has introduced it with 19.5 : 9 aspect ratios .
however , let me tell where the super amoled screen was given in the pro version .
at the same time , this phone will get a simple ips insel display .
at the same time , its screen size is also large .
however the display is good and you will like it .
the vivo v15 has been introduced on the mediatek helio p70 chipset .
the f11 pro , which was recently launched by opo , works only on the p70 chipset .
along with this , 64 gb memory with 6 gb ram has been given .
the phone has a 4,000 mah battery available for power backup .
can &apos;t talk about performance right now because we are not very used .
it is also read samsung galaxy m20 review : all-rounder performance and strong battery makes it
work on the vivo v15 of the particular vivo v15 company based on android operating system 9 pie .
with funtouch you will get good options like speed up , iprotection and low power mode .
both phones of vivo v15 series are quite special in terms of camera .
you will also get a pop-up selfie camera in this phone .
its selfie camera is 32-megapixel which comes with f / 2.0 aperture .
the pop-up camera of the phone emerges while taking a selfie and then hides itself in the body .
at the same time , triple camera setup will be seen in the rear panel .
in which the main sensor is 24-megapixel ( 12 x 2 ) which comes with f / 1.8 aperture .
it supports pdaf .
the company has used pixel binning technology where there is a 12-mp sensor but is capable of taking pictures at 24-mp .
the second sensor is 8-megapixels , which supports wide angle .
along with the auto mode with the camera , options such as pro panorama , ai beauty and ar sticker will be available .
dual sim support has been provided in vivo v15 .
bluetooth and wifi will be available in the phone .
it has a micro usb port for data and charging .
the price of vivo v15 is rs 23,990 .
there are many challenges before the phone in this price .
it will be said to be a little lacking , but let me say that the company has introduced it with fast charging support .
with the box in vivo v15 , you will also get cable , power adapter , phone case and earphones , which can be said to be very good .
people will compare it with v15 pro and opo f11 .
in that sense , this phone will be called good .
but there is also samsung &apos;s a50 handset in this budget , which is considered to be quite powerful and also has a 25-mp selfie and triple rear camera .
so , if the price was a little lower then it would have been better .
xiaomi has introduced its cheapest phone redmi go in india .
the name go refers to its operating system in this phone of the redmi series .
the company has introduced it with google &apos;s android go operating system .
android go is a lightweight operating system that runs smoothly on low ram and memory .
in the indian market , this phone is available in a budget of rs 4,499 and from 22 march it is going for sale .
many phones have been received in this budget so far .
but none of them was what you would call the best in quality and specification .
now with the arrival of xiaomi , there has been a rise in people and everyone wants to know whether this phone is worth shopping or will the low range phone be underestimated ? although we are not telling the complete review right now , but we will definitely share the first glimpse or first experience , so that you will know a lot about the phone .
redmi go is not new in terms of design .
this phone is made of polycarbonate and looks very similar to the xiaomi redmi 5a launched in 2017 .
however , it will definitely be said that the phone is very compact and comes in the palm very comfortably .
the body of the phone is made on the metal frame but the back panel is of polycarbonate plastic .
in such a situation , you can walk for hours by putting it in your hand or pocket .
however , the back panel gives you a metallic feel which we liked very much .
it weighs just 137 grams .
xiaomi redmi go will give you a 5-inch screen .
hardware buttons and slots are where the xiaomi phones are often seen .
the right panel has a volume and power button .
sim and card slot on the left side , usb and loudspeaker grill below and audio jack on top .
read this also : know which phone is in xiaomi redmi 7 and samsung galaxy
m10 , it can be said that you will see big bezel below and above the screen .
whereas today the trend of bezel less phones .
there is no newness in the design but you can say that the built quality is very good .
best in this price range .
also read : samsung galaxy m10 review : redmi 6 falls in design and performance
the screen resolution of the heavy phone is hd ( 1280 × 720 pixels ) .
in this range , it will be called a good resolution , but the drawback can be said that the company has not given the information about lamination .
at the same time , this phone is built on the old 16 : 9 aspect ratio , while the new phone has a 19 : 9 aspect ratio .
a slight decrease can be said here .
although the display is good and the view angle is also good in terms of price .
the company has introduced xiaomi redmi go on qualco mm &apos;s snapdragon 425 chipset and will have a 1.4 ghz quadcore processor .
along with this , 1 gb ram memory and 8 gb internal memory has been given .
the phone has memory card support .
however , let me tell you that it is the weakest in the hardware section itself .
xiaomi introduced redmi 5a in 2017 and at that time this phone was available for rs 4,999 .
the phone had 16 gb memory with 2 gb ram .
at the same time , this phone also worked on qualco mm &apos;s 425 chipset .
in such a situation , after a year and a half , redmi go has been launched for just 500 rupees less with the old processor , 1 gb ram and 8 gb memory .
therefore , questions will definitely arise regarding hardware .
this phone works on the android operating system 8.1 go edition .
google has also launched the go edition of android 9 pie .
in such a situation , the os will also be called slightly older .
however , we did not see any lag in the initial performance .
at the same time , due to go edition , its apps and games become very light and they take less memory .
redmi go has an 8-megapixel single rear camera for photography .
the company has introduced it with f / 2.0 aperture and it also has auto focus support .
the front camera of the phone is 5-megapixels which you can use for selfie as well as video chat .
this sensor comes with f / 2.2 aperture .
nice early experience .
not very good .
here too , we will give more information during the detail review .
xiaomi redmi go has dual sim support and you can use 4g volte in both slots .
at the same time , it can be said that the phone has a separate microsd card slot with two sim slots .
you can use two sims with a memory card .
wifi and bluetooth will be available in the phone .
the phone has usb 2.0 support , which is
given a 3,000 mah battery in xiaomi redmi go .
the battery is also slightly less .
at least 3,500 mah would have been better .
if you look at the xiaomi redmi go phone , then the specification and design will look good in every case .
but as soon as you compare it with the redmi 5a launched a year and a half ago , then there is a problem for the phone .
many advanced features were available in just 500 rupees more .
at the same time, looking at the price range of shaami, we were hoping for a lower prize for this phone.
if it was less than rs 4,000 , it would have been called the best .
despite this , it can be said that if you want to move from a feature phone to a smartphone , then you can shop right .
users eagerly wait for xiaomi &apos;s every device .
last month , the company introduced the redmi note 7 pro in india .
at the same time , the company has launched xiaomi redmi 7 in china where its price is around 8,000 rupees .
it is expected that this phone will also be available in india soon .
according to the budget , in the indian market , this phone of xiaomi will get a direct competition from samsung &apos;s new galaxy m10 , which is equipped with notch drop and dual camera .
in such a situation , those users who are planning to take the samsung galaxy a10 would definitely want to know which phone is the best ? is it good to get samsung galaxy m10 or wait for xiaomi redmi 7 .
so , we have come up with a small specification based specification where you can guess by yourself which device is better for you .
you will not get newness in the design of xiaomi redmi 7 .
like the note 7 pro , it has a vader drop notch , which has a selfie camera .
on the three sides where there are light bezels and the bottom bezel is slightly larger .
the body of the phone is made of glass and the good thing can be said that the company has protected it with gorilla glass .
the phone is good to look at but you will say that it is a xiaomi phone .
the body of the samsung galaxy m10 is made of polycarbonate plastic , shiny . the phone is quite slick and easily fits into the palm .
the company has introduced it with water drop notch , which the company has named infinity v.
there is a selfie camera on the notch itself .
the phone is good to look at and is quite different from the samsung phone launched so far .
the redmi 7 features a 6.26-inch display with a 19 : 9 aspect ratio available in hd + ; 1520 × 720 pixels resolution .
used the tft display so the corning gorilla 5 comes with a protection .
the samsung galaxy m10 has a 6.2-inch hd + screen .
the company has introduced it with 19.5 : 9 aspect ratios while the phone &apos;s screen resolution is 720 x 1520 pixels .
in this budget , only phones with hd screens are available .
the company has introduced it with dragontrail coating .
the good thing can be said that the bezels are very less in it .
you can see that no one is behind each other in both design and display .
redmi 7 comes with android &apos;s latest os android 9 pie based mui 10 .
this phone works on qualco mm snapdragon 632 chipset and it has an octa-core processor with 1.8 ghz clock speed .
with this , the company has introduced it with 16 gb memory with 2 gb ram , 32 gb memory with 3 gb ram and 64 gb internal storage with 4 gb ram .
the samsung galaxy m10 has been introduced by the company on the exynos 7870 chipset .
this phone has an octa-core processor with 1.6 ghz clock speed in it .
although this processor is slightly older .
but in the budget of 8,000 rupees will be said to be quite good .
this phone is available in 16 gb memory with 2 gb ram and 32 gb memory with 3 gb ram and both models have microsd card support .
samsung galaxy m10 runs on android operating system 8.1 oreo which is based on samsung experience ui 9.5 .
the company has already given information that samsung galaxy m10 will get an update on 9 pie in august .
in such a situation , it can be said that there will be no backtrack but right now only by name but it is a little behind in the update
talking about photography segment , redmi 7 supports dual rear camera .
the back panel of the phone has a 12-megapixel primary and 2-megapixel secondary camera with f / 2.2 aperture with flashlight .
similarly , the 8-megapixel front camera is available in the notch of redmi 7 for selfie .
similarly , for power backup this phone has a battery of 4,000 mah .
the samsung galaxy m10 also comes with dual camera setup .
the company has made it 13-megapixel + 5-megapixel .
its main camera is with f / 1.9 aperture which is for low light photography .
at the same time , the second sensor comes with f / 2.2 aperture which has wide angle support up to 120 degrees .
the galaxy m10 &apos;s selfie camera is 5-megapixels .
selfie camera cases will be slightly behind , but m10 is much better in camera segment .
wide angle overshadows large aperture radmi .
connectivity and battery
xiaomi redmi 7 has 4g volte support .
while the rear fingerprint sensor has been given for security along with other basic connectivity features , this phone also supports face unlock feature .
the samsung galaxy m10 has micro usb 2.0 for data transfer and charging .
the phone has dual sim support and you can take advantage of 4g volte on both sims .
the company has given three slots in it where you can use two sims with one card .
however , fingerprint scanner will not be available in it .
the company has given face unlock .
the good thing can be said that on earphones you can enjoy music in 360 surround sound .
it has dolby atmos integration .
for power backup , samsung galaxy m10 has a battery of 3,400 mah .
overall , the redmi 7 weighs heavily on the galaxy m10 in terms of design and battery .
along with this , the fingerprint scanner also puts redmi ahead .
but the camera is bigger than the galaxy m10 dolby atmos makes it a better multimedia device .
in such a situation , one can say that no one is far behind and if you want to go towards the brand then there is no doubt that samsung is big .
if you want , you can shop for the galaxy m10 .
today , many smartphone companies have removed the 3.5 mm headphone jack in their smartphones , including oneplus , apple and google .
in some phones of these companies , you will not get to see 3.5  mm jack .
due to this , bluetooth headphones are becoming quite popular in the market , in which you will get to listen to music without wire tension .
these bluetooth headphones are liked by people who like listening to music during workouts and traveling .
however , there are many companies in the market that will provide you with one of the best headphones with long battery , features and great look .
we used one of those skalkandi riff wireless headphones and tried to know if it is better than other headphones in the market ?
if you talk about skalkandi , then this company has been making headphones for many decades .
the company makes wire and wireless headphones as well as earphones .
youth likes skalkandi &apos;s product because they come with a very trendy design and color .
during the next review , do you know what is best for you riff wireless scalcandy headphones .
skalkandi riff wireless headphones are priced at rs 5,999 which is not cheap at all .
trendy look and light weight can be called usp of this headphones .
you can buy this headphones from offline and online platforms .
design and specifications :
riff wireless bluetooth over-the-ear headphones that cover your ear perfectly .
at the same time , the other two buttons are for reducing and speeding up the volume .
these buttons can also be used to move songs back and forth .
apart from this , the right cup has a microusb port for charging downwards .
but , in this you will not get 3.5 mm jack i.e. after the battery is down the users will not be able to listen to music with the help of wire .
the mathematics behind this may also be that smartphone companies are removing the 3.5 mm headphone jack in their phones .
perhaps this is the reason scalakandy may have removed the 3.5 mm jack in its headphones , or rather the company wants to offer this headphone as a pure bluetooth headphone .
this may also mean that the company does not want to compromise the quality of the music , so the 3.5 mm jack has been removed .
many times using bluetooth headphones with wire makes a difference in the quality of music .
the riff wireless headphones are available for purchase in three color options .
you can buy it in black , white blue and gray colors .
however , these headphones do not support any kind of high-resolution audio streaming .
however , the unit that came to us for review is in gray color .
it does not spoil on repeated use .
at the same time , it also looks very good .
however , upon seeing this , you will not be sure that its price is rs 5,999 .
this headphone is quite light .
its total weight is 159 grams .
use of headphones will not be limited to just listening to music .
at the same time , it has a multi-color led that keeps on burning after the headphones are turned on .
at the same time , this light also gives the indication of battery down .
riff uses a cup of 40 mm driver present in wireless headphones .
at the same time , its frequency will be 20 hz to 20,000 hz .
apart from this , you can keep this headphone connected to one device at a time .
talking about the box , users get a micro-usb charging cable and a quick start guide in it .
apart from this , you will not find any case to carry headphones .
however , there is a small bag with plenty of headphones , in which the headphones can be folded .
the sound effect of this bluetooth headphone , which comes at a price of rs 5,999 , can be called quite spectacular .
initially the headphones faced a problem to connect to the smartphone , but after long pressing the power button of the headphones , this problem was fixed .
long-pressing the power button goes into headphones restart mode and connects to the smartphone .
if you loud the volume in this headphones , a little bit of noise comes out .
at the same time , to check the given microphone , it is also talked on the phone by using headphones .
it comes with noise cancell .
however , its price is slightly higher .
at this price , if you are looking for earphones instead of a headphone then oneplus bullet can be called the best .
if we talk about battery life , then the company claims about the battery given in this riff wireless that it lasts for 12 hours .
this headphone can be charged up to 100 percent in just one hour .
an indication shows in the phone about its battery , from which you can get information about the battery percentage of the headphones .
after charging it , you can use headphones according to your need to listen to songs , play games and talk .
i used headphones in the free time of the day and listened to some songs .
during this time the battery backup of this headphone was quite excellent .
riff wireless will not disappoint you in terms of battery .
its battery gives you more than 12 hours of backup .
buy or not ?
there is no doubt that the riff wireless headphone is a stylish headphone that comes with a good battery life .
apart from this , its audio quality is quite good , for which skalkandi is known .
this headphone was launched for rs 5,999 .
however , on many online sites you can buy it at a lower price .
the price can be said to be reasonable given the brand of skalkandi .
if you are looking for a stylish headphone then this can be purchased .
however , around this price you can see the sony sony-wh-ch500 , which is priced at rs 3,999 and infinix quite x , which is priced at rs 6,999 .
apart from this , the price of headphones can vary online and offline .

smartphone brands offer powerful ram and processors and devices with great styling and camera setup , which are well-liked by tech lovers .
whether the phone is of low budget segment or high end flagship device , the specifications and features of every smartphone remain dull when the phone battery leaves it .
it is the battery of the smartphone that works to revive it .
no matter how expensive the phone is , but it is useless if there is no battery .
today , tech companies are launching their smartphones equipped with large batteries .
but if the mango is out and the phone battery is low , &apos; power bank &apos; is most useful .
whether it is travel or picnic , power bank is being considered a very important kit in all this .
to relieve smartphone users from the fear of battery discharge at the last moment , the famous company tag has launched a very luxurious and power bank , which has been launched in the market with the name &apos; tag turbo 20,000 &apos; .
how this power bank is special from others , we have highlighted the same thing in our review .
along with the
look and design , the tag turbo 20000 is also great in look .
the company has built this power bank on the metallic body .
the power bank is short in width and high in length .
yes , it feels slightly heavier in weight due to the larger cell , but the low width of the power bank makes it a good grip .
this power bank fits perfectly in the palm .
on the upper part of the tag turbo , where 2 outputs and 1 input slot are given , on the lower part , information about watt , dc and mah is printed .
the power button is provided with led notification on the upper side on the front side of the power bank .
through this power button , the charging mode of the power bank can be turned on and off .
the tag logo is also on this panel .
according to the information given by the company , the dimension of the tag turbo is 172 * 61 * 22 mm and weighing 370 grams .
the power bank &apos;s power
tag turbo 20,000 itself shows that it has a 20,000 mah battery .
there are only a few power banks in the market that support 20,000 mah battery .
not only this , the tag turbo 20,000 is also the first power bank of the company .
tag turbo 20000 has 6 high capacity lithium-ion cells .
during charging the power bank has not seen any problem of hitting anywhere .
during use , once in full charge , the tag turbo 20000 was fully charged with 4 smartphones one after the other .
tag turbo 20000 has two outputs and one input source for
easy and fast charging phone charging .
both output slots of the power bank have a 2.4a charging port .
the major feature of this power bank is also that through tag turbo 20000 , two smartphones can be charged simultaneously in both slots with fast charging technology .
likewise , the tag turbo 20000 has a 2a input charging port , which automatically supplies the power bank cell when it is supplied more or less than required .
smartphone protecting features
the tag turbo 20000 power bank supports stable dual-device charging , which prevents any smartphone battery from fluctuating during charging .
tag turbo 20000 is bis certified , which makes it safe for users .
at the same time , the company has launched it in the market with pcb surge protection , due to which the risk of shock in the circuits is greatly reduced .
similarly , this power bank also supports universal compatibility and intelligent ic which protects the motherboard of powerbank as well as the smartphone and its battery .
price and availability
tag turbo 20000 has been launched by the company at a price of rs 2499 .
this power bank has become available for sale on amazon india in black and gun metal color variants .
looking at the price and look of the tac turbo 20000 , it can be called a great power bank .
as we have already mentioned , this power bank may seem a bit heavy in weight , but if you want to move 20,000 mah power in your fist , then this weight does not matter much .
there was a time when nokia fons ruled the indian market and samsung was challenging its reign .
we had a conversation with a samsung official and we said that why do you think you will one day become india &apos;s number one smartphone maker ? replying to this , he said that the biggest feature of samsung is that we adapt technology very fast and are very competitive in terms of price .
and watch the game of time , leaving behind nokia , the company has become the world &apos;s number one mobile manufacturer , not only in india .
samsung launched the stylish corby , star and galaxy phones which were highly appreciated by the people .
but for the last few years in india , samsung &apos;s reign was challenged by xiaomi and the company lost its place again .
however , the reason behind this was that it was the strength of samsung earlier .
samsung phones were slightly more expensive than chinese mobile manufacturers , and were also far behind in technology adoption .
but from the year 2019 , the company has changed its strategy again and made a bang entry with m series .
samsung has launched the galaxy m10 and galaxy m20 .
there is a lot of discussion about these phones .
a few days ago we have published a review of m20 , which can be read by clicking here .
at the same time , we are going to explain about m10 in detail .
the initial price of samsung galaxy m10 in the indian market is rs 7,990 and this phone is available on online store amazon india .
also can be taken from samsung store .
there are good devices in this budget such as xiaomi redmi 6 and realme c1 .
in such a situation , the question is whether the galaxy m10 is strong enough to leave behind the bulky phones like xiaomi and realme .
in this review we tried to know the same .
despite the budget phone , the samsung galaxy m10 is smart to watch .
its body is made of polycarbonate plastic which is quite shiny .
the best thing that can be said is that despite having a shiny body , it does not slip by hand and gives good grip .
the bottom has a 3.5 mm audio jack and micro usb slot .
this time you can see a difference in the design that the volume rocker and power button are given in the right panel while the left panel has a sim slot .
we have seen before that in samsung phones , the volube button and the power button were on two different sides .
however , it does not make much difference in user experience .
as for all over design , we have also used samsung galaxy m20 , but the experience of samsung galaxy m10 was much better .
this phone is more slick and easily fits into the palm .
you will like the weight and size of the phone and you can move it in your hand or pocket for a long time .
it can be said that the design is one of the best looking phones in a low budget and the quality of the phone is also very good .
yes , if asked to remove a deficiency , then we can say that there would be metal design which would be more fun .
arrived in front of android &apos;s new os android q , learn how the new features
are available in some notch screen phones though less range but has introduced samsung galaxy m 10 votrdrop notch .
however , it is important to mention here that it has been named infiniti v by samsung rather than the nokia display .
on infiniti v , you will see a selfie camera .
xiaomi redmi note 6 pro and asus zenfone max pro m2 know which phone is
the display of the best phone is very bright and wireless .
you will not have any problem in seeing the screen even in strong sunlight .
its touch response is also quite good .
the screen of the phone comes with asahi dragon trail coating which is capable of protecting it from minor scratches .
it has adaptive brightness support where the light itself adjusts according to the light .
given the price of the phone , you cannot remove any reduction in the display .
it has an octa-core processor with 1.6 ghz clock speed .
although you can say that it is a slightly older processor , but let me say that earlier the company has used it in its 15 – 20 thousand rupees phone , now it has brought it in the budget of 8,000 rupees .
this phone is available in 16 gb memory with 3 gb ram and 32 gb memory with 3 gb ram and both models have microsd card support .
regarding performance , you can say that this phone is not very fast but has the power to compete with any device of this budget .
during the experiment we played the game with balance graphics and low frame rate on it and it was running smoothly .
however , at mid frame rate you may face problems .
yes , there is no heating at all .
apart from this , this phone is able to easily handle daily tasks .
although you can say that if there were 9 pies , it would have been called the best .
but the company has already informed that in august , both the models including samsung galaxy m10 and m20 will be updated to 9 pie .
the phone has some good gesture based features .
at the same time , we liked the options like game launcher and gaming tools quite well .
in game performance you can set whether you want better game performance and want battery saving .
at the same time , the option of gaming tools will come only while playing the game .
here you can control call and message notifications , as well as recording of the game .
apart from this , the infinity animation of the phone will also impress you .
on the screen , a light lights up with the notch , which makes it different from the other notch .
if you wish , you can turn off the notch in the display inside the option settings .
the company has introduced this phone with dual rear camera setup .
this is samsung &apos;s lowest priced dual camera phone .
however , the low price does not mean that the quality is poor .
it is very good in this budget .
the phone has live focus support with both front and rear cameras where you can take pictures with a blur background .
there are options like pro mode , beauty and stickers with the main camera .
hdr will also be available in the settings .
the quality of the picture taken outdoors was very good with this phone .
the most special thing that we felt was that the colors of the picture taken from the phone were absolutely real .
the color was not teased during the revision .
yes you may have some problem taking blur background picture .
according to the pictures we took , it was blurring by detecting the face .
the blur background was having a bit of trouble with something else .
the beauty mode of the phone is also good .
gets the photos a little sharper .
the wide angle camera of the phone works quite well and this feature makes it stand out from the others .
you may have some trouble in low light but remember that in this budget you will not get f / 1.9 aperture in any phone at the moment .
the phone &apos;s selfie camera is also good , but you cannot expect much from it .
it does not have a front flash but in low light the screen light proves to be quite effective for selfies .
wifi and bluetooth have been provided for connectivity .
at the same time , you would also like to know that the phone has dolby atmos integration for better music .
on earphones you can enjoy music in 360 surround sound .
but the deficiency can be said that this time the company has not provided earphones with the sales pack .
although 4,000 mah battery is in operation today , you may feel a little low , but let me tell you that battery backup is very good .
once fully charged the average is able to take a day and a half of rest during use .
the samsung galaxy m10 has face unlock support but does not have a fingerprint scanner .
the price of 2 gb ram model of samsung galaxy m10 in the indian market is rs 7,990 .
at the same time , a phone with 3 gb ram can be taken for rs 8,990 .
if you compare the features of samsung galaxy m10 according to the price , then it can be called one of the best phones in the range of less than rs 8,000 .
the phone has usb waterdrop notch , dual camera , wide angle support and great battery backup .
yes , it can be called a fingerprint scanner as a deficiency .
if it were then it would have been difficult to match it .
despite this , it can be said that the budget of 8,000 rupees is able to make full recovery of your money and you can buy it .
if compared to xiaomi redmi 6 , yes , the galaxy m10 proves to be much better than that .

honor has been looking very aggressive since the beginning of the new year .
in january , the company has launched two phones .
first introduced the honor 10 lite in the low range and now in the premium segment , the company has introduced the honor view 20 .
this phone is special in many ways .
it has a powerful camera along with a new design .
the initial price of this phone in the indian market is rs 37,999 and it can be taken from reliance digital apart from amazon india store .
however , considering the price and specification , the view 20 is considered to be the biggest competitor of oneplus 6t .
during this review , we also tried to know whether it actually proved to be the best from oneplus .
the first glimpse of honor view 20 will impress you .
looking at the phone , you can say that yes it is smarter than oneplus 6t .
the phone has been introduced on the metal frame but has a back panel glass finish .
although it is not of glass, it is polycarbonate but will make you feel very good.
in the indian market , this phone comes in three attractive colors but we had safire blue .
as we have seen , in the last one year , the launch of honor phone has used gradian color .
you will get something similar in this phone too , but the style has changed .
the company has used the v shape shape in the phone which is quite attractive.
we have not seen such a style in any phone so far .
at the same time , the color of the vshape gradian also changes when the phone is slightly slanted or rotated .
it gives effects like rainbow colors .
another special thing on the previous panel is worth noting .
it has a dual rear camera .
but the main camera is kept slightly apart while the secondary camera and flash are together .
whereas in most phones till now we had seen the camera simultaneously .
the phone has been introduced in curved design .
it is slightly raised from the middle while the corners are quite slick .
in this case , it gives a good grip to grip .
know which phone is in honor 10 lite and xiaomi redmi note 6 pro , the
fingerprint scanner has been given in the best back panel .
the hardware button is on the right panel of the phone while the sim slot is given on the left panel .
the upper panel of the phone has a 3.5 mm audio jack and ir blaster , and the lower panel has a loudspeaker and usb type-c port .
overall it is excellent in terms of design .
yes , due to the shiny panel , you can remove the lack of fingerprints but it is much less than other devices .
also , it is easily removed .
honor view 20 has a 6.4-inch super fullhd + screen .
the discussion of this phone is also being discussed due to its new nokia style .
however , it has been named the punch hole display and not the notch .
it is the first phone to be launched in india with a punch hole display .
it has a paper punch style like hole on the screen on which the front camera is available .
the most important thing that can be said is that it works when the phone is touched on the punch hole during use .
till now we had seen the display in the middle of the cutout screen in the nokia display , which causes many problems when gaming or watching videos .
at the same time , the camera in this phone is on the left side and it goes down while watching gaming or video .
elements do not come to the place where this happens .
in such a situation , you will be able to use the whole screen .
the bezels on the screen are very low and the bottom chin is also very thin .
sensors in the phone are given below due to the bezel free above .
the company claims that the screen to body ratio of the phone is more than 91 percent .
the display of the phone is bright and you will also like the design .
it is quite compact despite the big screen .
because of this you will be able to use almost the entire screen of the phone with one hand .
yes , if you compare the display quality with the oneplus , it falls a bit behind .
oneplus has been introduced with oled display while it has lcd panel .
as we have already said , honor view 20 is the company &apos;s premium phone and the company has launched it with premium specification .
this phone works on huawei &apos;s highsilicon kirin 980 chipset and has a 2.6 ghz octa-core processor .
it is the first phone in the world to use 7 nanometer fabrication .
there is mali-g76 mp10 gpu for better graphics .
the company says that it has been equipped with gpu turbo 2.0 which is capable of giving you great gaming performance .
in the indian market , samsung galaxy view 20 has been introduced in two memory variants .
one model comes with 6 gb ram , with 128 gb internal memory .
at the same time , the second model comes with 8 gb ram and has a memory of 256 gb .
in terms of performance , this phone is quite great and here we can say that oneplus 6t does not stop anywhere .
in it you can easily play games with high graphics .
with this , no matter how many apps and tabs you open simultaneously .
it works smoothly .
during about 10 days of usage , we did not see any hanging problem in it .
honor view 20 has been introduced on android &apos;s latest operating system android 9 pie which works on the company &apos;s user interface magic ui 2.0 .
although earlier the phone used to see the emotion ui , but the magic ui is no different .
yes , you will get to use very good gestures in the phone .
you can take a screenshot by double tapping with one finger and the screen can be recorded by tapping with two fingers .
however , we found the best feature in this phone is wireless projection .
screen mirroring happens in every phone today .
but this phone of honor is one step ahead in it .
in this , if you connect your phone to the tv from the wifi network , then there will be the option of desktop mode along with mirroring , on clicking it your phone will become a mouse pad and the contents of the phone on the tv will come like a desktop .
you will be able to use it from the phone itself .
at the same time , like samsung decks , it also has desktop mode support where you can connect the phone with any display through hdmi cable .
it has motion game support and you can play a motion game by keeping the phone away by connecting it with a bigger screen .
along with good design and specification , you will also get to see a strong camera in honor view 20 .
the phone has a dual rear camera setup and the main sensor is 48-megapixels .
the company has introduced it with f / 1.8 aperture which is capable of taking good pictures even in low light conditions .
at the same time , sony imx 586 sensor has been used for good photography .
this is the first phone in the world in which this sensor has been given .
at the same time , the second camera of the phone is tof which is for depth sensing and 3d detection .
there is ai integration with the camera .
the company claims that 22 sins have been prepared for this , which enhance the photos themselves by sensing anything , skin tone and color etc .
it is very good about camera quality .
in low light photography it is slightly behind oneplus otherwise it is far ahead in blur background , wide angle and microshot .
in the blur background , it identifies things very well and cuts it out which gives dslr-like results .
we have no complaints from the phone &apos;s rear camera .
the front camera is 25-megapixels , which comes with f / 2.0 aperture .
the selfie camera also gives simple performance in low light .
but it also has bokeh effect and hdr mode which works very well .
at the same time , the phone has ar feature which is quite fun .
honor view 20 is a dual sim phone that supports 4g volte .
in both sims you can use 4g volte .
the phone has bluetooth 5.0 with wifi .
it also has an ir blaster through which you can use the phone as a universal remote .
talking about security , in addition to the fingerprint sensor , face unlock also supports the feature .
it has a microsd port for data and charging .
for power backup , this phone of honor has a battery of 4,000 mah , which supports fast charging .
when fully discharged , it becomes full charged in about one and a half hours .
the battery backup of the phone is very good and in our video loop test it lasted for about 18 hours , which can be said to be a very good thing .
the price of 6 gb ram model of honor view 20 is rs 37,999 .
at the same time , the model with 8 gb ram can be purchased for rs 45,999 .
there is no doubt that honor view 20 is a good phone .
but in terms of shopping , the base variant will be said to be quite good in price but the 8 gb model is a bit expensive .
on the other hand , if you compare it with oneplus 6t , then it can be said that in many cases it is ahead .
especially the design , camera and battery are quite impressive .
in performance it is no less then no less .
at the same time , features like desktop and 3g motion make the view 20 even better .
last year , news came that samsung will soon launch its new m series phone which will replace the company &apos;s j series phones .

the biggest feature of these samsung phones is that they have not only been introduced in the new series but have also been introduced with new thinking .
by launching such phones in early 2019 , the company has shown what it is going to do in the coming year .
looking at these , you can say that the company has changed completely .
whether it is style , features or price .
in every case , these phones are now seen competing with other brands .

we used it for about a week before the review and whatever information was received is in front of you .
samsung galaxy a7 review : triple camera camera and stylish design but slightly slower

although there are few fingerprints on the body during use , but they also get cleaned easily .
on the rear panel , you will see flash with dual camera .
the design of the side has changed slightly .

this time there are power and volume buttons on the right side of the phone .
while the sim slot is given on the left side .
the upper panel is empty while the lower panel has a charging port , 3.5 mm audio jack and loudspeaker grill .

it is quite easy to use and some good features will also be seen .

wide angle photography makes it stand out from other competitors .
the picture quality taken from the phone is good and has the potential to compete with any device in this range .
however , we were expecting better picture quality from the samsung brand .

screen flash has been given in this phone for selfie in low light .
with the front camera also you will get the option of blur background , which the company has named selfie focus .

every segment has been noticed in this phone .

whether it is design or display , processor or camera , or battery and price , this is a good option in every case .
in a budget of rs 10,990 , it is very impressive .
yes , the phone worth rs 12,990 will be challenged by the phones of xiaomi and asus .
in this budget , the redmi note 6 pro and zenfone max pro m2 are strong .

for power backup , the phone has a battery of 3,020 mah and once fully charged it takes out the whole day .
finally , after looking at everything about the phone , it can be said that it is very stylish and the quality is also great .
the specifications are also good and there will be no significant problem in performance as well .
the camera is also ok .
yes , there can be some problem with a phone with 2 gb ram .
this phone is available for rs 8,499 and rs 9,499 .
in such a situation , one can say that the initial model is a bit expensive .
if there was 3 gb of ram in this range , then it would have been better .
despite this , if you are shopping from its offline store , then it has the power to give tough competition to phones like oppo-vivo .
a few days ago , honor introduced the v20 model in china .
at the same time , it was informed that soon this phone will be available in other countries as well .
at the same time , vibration had also told that outside china it will not be offered as v20 but vue 20 and now this phone is going to be available in india .
although the company is going to officially introduce it in india on january 29 , but before that we have come and we have come with its first glimpse .
from where you can get complete information about the style and features of the phone .
honor phones launched in the last few years are very stylish to watch and the company has introduced them with a very attractive look .
you will get something similar in this phone too .
gradian color has been used in the back panel of the phone , as is often seen in honor &apos;s device .
but the texture is different .
if the phone lights up , then you will see a v shape which is completely new .
you would not have felt this in any phone till now .
the dual camera style in the rear panel of the phone is also different .
the main camera is completely separated on the left side while there is a horizontal design on which the secondary camera and flash are available .
the hardware button is on the side panel .
the upper panel has a 3.5 mm audio jack and ir blaster , while the lower panel has a loudspeaker and usb type-port .
oneplus 6t cell starts today , see its first glimpse and know the answers to all the questions related to it
this phone of sleek design is very attractive to watch and the corners are a little round , so it will give a much better feeling in the grip .
however , despite the large screen , the phone is quite compact .
you can use almost the entire screen with one hand .
the company has introduced it with 19.5 : 9 aspect ratios and it will get a different type of notch .
it was first started by samsung with the galaxy a8s but this phone has become available only in china .
sensors in the phone are given below because the top bezel is free .
the honor v20 has been introduced on android &apos;s latest operating system android 9 pie which works on the company &apos;s user interface emui 9 .
the company has given some good apps in it including screen recorder and wireless projection .
in wireless projection , you can connect the tv to the phone without any additional wifi .
the company has introduced this phone on the kirin 980 chipset for processing .
the phone has a 2.6 ghz octa-core processor .
however , we cannot talk much about performance right now .
on behalf of the company , 128 gb internal memory has been given in honor v20 with 6 gb ram .
microsd card support is not provided in this .
the honor v20 is also very special in the photography segment .
its main camera is 48-megapixels and the company has used the sony imx 586 sensor .
there is another tof sensor for depth sensing and 3d detection .
honor v20 is a dual sim phone that supports 4g volte .
along with basic connectivity features , where the fingerprint sensor has been provided on the back panel of the phone for security in this phone , this phone also supports face unlock feature .
ir blaster is also very beneficial for you .
it is too early to talk about battery performance or cameras now .
we will talk about this in detail in full review .
in the sales pack of honor view 20 , the main unit will get usb type c cable , power adapter and a silicon cover .
earphones not available .
currently , the price of the phone is not known but it is expected that this phone will be available in india in a budget of rs 35,000 .
the popularity of social media is not hidden from anyone today .
be it the prime minister or the ceo of a tech company , social media is his main weapon to make his point public .
to say something , to do something or to do something , just put a post on social media and after that there was a flurry of likes and comments .
the best thing is that direct communication is established from here , without any third medium , you can communicate directly to the people and know the reactions of others .
if we talk about the mobile world , then the use of social media has got to be seen even better .
barring a few , almost all companies are quite active on social media , which has also benefited them .
everyday new tech innovations take place .
new phones are launched phones .
apart from this , there are many things including the company &apos;s strategy , offers and after sales service .
a special strategy has to be devised to make people aware of these things .
tv and print advertising can give you some information about things , but their scope is limited .
but if you are active on social media , then in just a few moments you can reach out to millions of people .
the most important thing that can be said is that your powers are not limited here .
you can discuss everything in detail including not just the launch but also innovation and after sales service .
here you can do everything according to yourself and if your social media management is better then the number 1 chair is not far from you .
you can take an example from brands like xiaomi and oneplus .
he stepped into india without any advertising and brand ambassador and achieved the number one position only on social media .
one is india &apos;s number one smartphone manufacturer , while the other is maintaining the reigns in the premium segment .
xiaomi &apos;s social movement
xiaomi stepped into india under the leadership of hugo bara and the company dominated social media from day one .
no tv ads nor advertisements in the news paper .
hugo himself was leading xiaomi &apos;s social media .
firstly he associated indian journalists with him and then with the common people .
with hugo joining , the media became involved with xiaomi itself , and the fast-paced online media gave plenty of coverage to every small step of the company .
in a short time , xiaomi &apos;s popularity began to speak .
after hugo bara left xiaomi , the command was in manu jain &apos;s hand and he used social media far more than hugo .
today , almost every day a tweet or facebook post of manu is made news .
social media xiaomi is so active that in the year 2018 , twitter released the list of top 10 engaging brands which held xiaomi number four .
while there were also big brands like opo and vivo in india which brought many innovations in 2018 , but could not make it to this list .
social media became the plus factor for oneplus ,
looking at the year 2018 , it seems that oneplus has great importance in social media management .
company brought 2 phones in a year , but looking at the way it is dominated on the internet , it seems as if someone is launching a new product everyday .
however , if you look at 2018 , oneplus has not launched any such innovative product .
the company first launched the nokia phone , later introduced the phone with du drop notch which had an in-display fingerprint scanner .
while you will see , all these innovations were already available in opo &apos;s phone .
the company could not achieve the same popularity as its oneplus in 2018 , despite the launch of great models like find x and r17 pro .
whether oneplus 6 or oneplus 6t both phones before and after the launch , the kind of social management that was seen was worth mentioning .
users were clapping on every post of the company .
due to this management , oneplus remained at number one in the twitter engagement list of 2018 .
honor and samsung also praised not
only xiaomi and oneplus , but big companies like honor and samsung are equally active on social media .
rather , you will be surprised if you see the investment level of these companies .
the number of followers of the facebook page of samsung india , more than 150 million .
at the same time , the company is sitting on twitter with more than 1.8 million followers .
the twitter follower of this same honor is 1.27 lakhs and facebook page likes are more than 21 lakhs .
apart from having a large user base , these companies are also very active on social media .
in terms of user engagement , these companies held the number and number two in the twitter list of the year 2018 .
by being active on social media , users feel connected to the companies and it benefits greatly when new products or offers come .
you do not have to make much effort to make your things available to the users .
ओपो की चमक रही फीकी
here are the names of those companies which strengthened their hold on the indian mobile market with the help of their best social media management .
but there are some companies among them , who despite being in a good position , lagged behind in social media management .
the first name of these comes from opo .
the company is ranked fourth in terms of mobile market share , but could not make it to the top 10 in terms of social media .
in the engagement trent of 2018 released by twitter , the top 5 are the only mobile companies but you are also out of the top 10 list .
however , it is not that the company does not have a social user base , but there has been a lack of social management .
opo &apos;s facebook page likes more than 30 million and twitter has over 4 lakh followers .
but on the post you can see the engagement yourself , how far behind companies like xiaomi oneplus and samsung are .
despite having a good user base and its excellent grip on offline channels , opo has lagged behind in terms of social media management and it seems that the company has to bear the brunt of this .
because in the beginning of the year 2018 , the company launched a great phone like f7 .
later , great phones such as the opo find x , opo f9 pro and r17 pro were introduced .
these phones were equipped with the latest technology , better camera , better still and the latest technology of charging .
innovations like slide out camera and wook charging were amazing .
despite this , there was more discussion of xiaomi &apos;s redmi phones , oneplus 6 series and honor phones .
in this way , we can say that if the social media management of opo was a little better , then perhaps the picture of the indian world will be slightly different in 2018 .
information about the new smartphone of poko , a sub-brand of chinese smartphone maker xiaomi , was revealed some time ago .
poco &apos;s general manager manmohan had given a hint of a new smartphone coming to his official twitter account .

apart from this , the 8 gb ram and 256 gb storage variants of the device were recently launched for rs 28,999 .
this device was introduced keeping in mind the gaming divas , whose price is much less than other flagship smartphones in the market .
pixel phones will be sold for half the price , the company is bringing the &apos; light &apos; version of pixel 3 and pixel 3 xl ,
xiaomi poco f1 has a 6.18-inch fullhd + display .
the device works on android 8.1 oreo .

nokia &apos;s smartphone-holding company hmd global recently introduced nokia 8.1 and 7.1 mobile phones .
at the same time , the company &apos;s new smartphone nokia 9 is being discussed for the last several months .
it was reported a few days ago that this phone will launch with 5 cameras .
today , new information about the phone has been revealed .
according to the information that has come about nokia 9 so far , most of the le has talked about the back panel of the device .
at the same time , now the front panel of nokia 9 is shown on slashleak .
in the live photo of this device you can see that a few bezels have been given above .
you might not like it a bit in the trend of hall noach and punch hole display .
the device also has a little bezel at the bottom along with the top .
although this panel may be , the design may be slightly different in the final product .
see first of all in the world , the first glimpse of
nokia 9 , the bezel given in exclusive nokia 9 on 91 mobiles is not as thick as we saw in nokia 8 .
it is expected that nokia 9 can be launched by hmd global in the next year i.e. 2019 .
based on the leaked photos , the top of the nokia 9 will be bezel , showing the front camera on the right and the branding of nokia on its equivalent .
at the same time , large bezels are also seen at the bottom .
but , one thing we did not understand is that if nokia &apos;s branding is given above , then what would be the benefit of having such a large bezel on the bottom .
however , at the moment it is a leaked photo , about which no official information has been revealed by the company .
according to earlier rumors , the nokia 9 will have an in-display fingerprint sensor .
at the same time , the discussion of having five rear cameras in the back of the device is also coming out for a long time .
talking about the rear camera , the penta camera in the phone i.e. the camera setup with 5 sensors can have a telephoto lens with two primary camera sensors .
at the same time , there may be a wide-angle lens and a depth-sensing camera sensor .
like other nokia smartphones , nokia 9 is also expected to be given the camera sensor of carl jessis .
apart from this , qualco mm snapdragon 845 processor can be given in this flagship device .
suddenly news came that xiaomi could launch the play series phones soon and it would be a replacement for the poco phone .
although the company did not say anything about this , but the play phone has been launched in china today .
till now the company used to launch its phones in some series including redmi , me and meeks but now a new series has been added as play .
this phone is equipped with many features , but we can say that there are some flaws in it and further we have mentioned these same strengths of xiaomi mi play .
skilfully
1 . water drop notch : somi m play company is the first phone that has water drop notch .
the phone has a 5.84-inch screen which is available with 19 : 9 aspect ratios .
the company has used a fullhd + screen with 1080 x 2246 pixels resolution .
xiaomi brand poco is bringing a new smartphone , oneplus
6t can leave 2 . shanadan processor : xiaomi mi play has been introduced by the company on mediatek &apos;s new helio p35 chipset .
in the phone you will find a 3.5 ghz octa-core processor .
there is an img ge 8320 gpu for graphics .
this processor is very powerful and has given special dual turbo smart acceleration for gaming in the phone , which will make the gaming experience more special .
along with this , there is 4 gb ram and 64 gb internal storage .
listing on samsung galaxy m30 benchmarking site , will be launched with 4gb ram
3 . dual rear camera : the specifications of the phone are quite good despite the low price .
the company has introduced it with a dual rear camera .
the phone has a sensor of 12-megapixels , while the other is given 2-megapixels .
with the rear camera , you will get hdr and eis support with portmode and blur background .
4 . dual volte : xiaomi mi play phone has dual sim support .
at the same time , it can be said that on both sims you can take advantage of 4g volte .
the company has introduced it with dual 4g support .
5 . usb type c : in low range phones , you mostly get to see microusb port , but the company has introduced xiaomi mi play with usb time-c port which supports fast charging .
apart from this , features like fingerprint scanner and face unlock have also been provided in the phone .
drawbacks
1 . weak battery : the company has introduced xiaomi mi play as a gaming phone , but the biggest drawback of this phone is that the phone has only 3,000 mah battery .
2 . small screen : with a small battery , small screen can also cause some trouble for heavy multimedia users .
although it uses the airdrop notch , the company has given a 5.84-inch screen .
a 6-inch or larger screen would have been better .
3 . no screen protection : the company has not provided information about screen protection for me play .
4 . old os : this phone works on android operating system 8.1 oreo .
most phones are still launching on the same android operating system .
despite this , it can be called old .
it would have been better if android 9 were on the pie .
it has been a long time since this os was launched .
5 . simple selfie : only 8-megapixel camera has been provided in xiaomi play for selfie .
for a good multimedia phone , we can expect a bit better .

at the same time , once again , both companies are face to face with the new device .

7 . powerful processor

it has an octa core processor with 2.8 ghz cryo architecture which is considered very powerful .
currently one of the fastest processors .
8 . in display fingerprint scanner

after this , this feature was also available in nex phones .
now the company has also given it in the new nex which is quite advanced .

10 . no front camera

also , there is no front facing camera .
you have to use the camera and screen provided in the back panel for selfie .
in may this year , the reality 1 model was launched .
people took this phone hand-in-hand .
after this , the company introduced realme 2 , realme 2 pro and then realme c1 .
all these phones proved to be the best in their budget .
the company &apos;s &apos; c &apos; series is known for its value for money .
it will get top notch features in a lesser range .
at the same time , there are all-rounder phones in the &apos; reality &apos; series .
similarly , realme offers flagship phones under the &apos; pro &apos; series , which not only top the style , but are also said to be great in terms of performance .
after all this , the company has now introduced reality u1 and u series has been called photography expert .
in this , you will get to see good specifications with the best camera .
the initial price of reality u1 in the indian market is rs 11,999 .
many other brands of phones are also available in this budget , including names like xiaomi .
in such a situation , the users have to question whether the purchase of xiaomi phone or realme u1 is the best ? so let me tell you that reality is not only the best but is ahead in every respect as compared to other brands .
you can also understand the things that we have done in this article .
1 . younger &apos;s choice
is a young style enthusiast and realme knows this very well .
therefore , every phone of the company is quite good in terms of style and u1 has no say .
you will die at the first glance of the phone .
it has been introduced with a glass back panel .
the panel of the phone is made of 13 layer micron level coating , whose quality is very good .
its acrylic transporter cover is quite solid and lightweight .
however , being light does not mean that it is weak , but it is able to support you for long periods of time and can easily withstand even small setbacks .
its edges are 2.5d curved and the company has prepared it with a special molding process so that you will get a great feeling when you hold the phone .
you will not find such a great quality in any other phone in this range .
in the indian market , this phone is available for sale in ambacious black , brave blue and fairy gold color .
2 . water drop notch
the company has introduced reality u1 with a new screen design trend .
the phone has a 6.3-inch fullhd + display with a 19.5 : 9 aspect ratio .
the company has used 2.5d curved gorilla glass 3 which provides protection as well as strength .
water drop notch is used in this .
reality u1 is the first phone in this range to get such a small notch .
its screen to body ratio is 90.8 percent .
in such a situation , you will not see anything except the screen on the front panel .
despite the large screen , it becomes quite compact due to the bezel lace .
in this case , you can easily use it with one hand .
while watching videos or playing games , it will give an absolutely theater-like experience .
that is , it is also ahead in display with design .
3 . top performance
reality u1 is the first phone in the world to be introduced on the mediatek helio p70 chipset .
it is designed on 12 nanometer fabrication .
the maximum processing capacity of this processor is 2.1 ghz clock speed .
it has two quad core processors .
one is on the cortex-a53 architecture for high efficiency while the other is on a quad-core processor cortex-a73 architecture used for high performance .
the company claims that it is 13 percent faster than the old helio p60 chipset .
at the same time , the battery pack also reduces by 15 percent .
on the other hand , if you compare it with the snapdragon 636 chipset used in the redmi note 6 pro or the kirin 710 used in the honor 8x , then it is even further .
the snapdragon 636 chipset is now outdated .
performance also confirms nttu benchmarks .
the entootu app measures the processor capacity of a mobile phone and gives it a score and when we tested it , reality u1 was at the forefront .
reality u1 managed to score up to 1,45,021 .
while the kirin 710 chipset honor 8x got a store of 1,39,786 , snapdragon 636 chipset based redmi note 6 pro managed to get a score of only 1,15,611 .
you can understand by yourself which phone is the best .
if you talk about gaming , in this case also you will not get any shortage from anywhere .
during the use of the phone , games with heavy graphics like pubg were played on it and we could not find the lag anywhere .
apart from this , we also played racing games like asphalt 9 and we did not get any complaints from the performance .
the phone was quite smooth .
in gaming performance , this honor proved to be much better than a phone like 8x .
4 . selfie expert

in the last few months , samsung has launched several phones one by one , including phones ranging from low range to high price .
however , if you look at the product portfolio of the company , you will find that the company has changed a lot .
on the one hand , even in low-range phones , glass body is now introduced .
at the same time , every phone is launching with infinity display .
these designs were earlier seen only in the company &apos;s expensive phones .
along with this , samsung has also brought some new innovations .
such as side finger print scanners and phones with 3 cameras and 4 cameras .
incidentally , samsung &apos;s 3 camera phone galaxy a7 2018 also came to us for review .
there is a lot of excitement about the samsung galaxy a7 and everyone wants to know how this phone is .
is its camera really amazing or are there three sensors rooted just for the name .
during the usage of the phone for about 15 days , we learned a lot about this phone and also mentioned it in detail in our review .
oneplus 6t : see the first glimpse of it and know the answers to all the questions related to it
the first word about the design can be said that it is very beautiful .
the phone is slim to watch and light enough .
in such a situation you can walk for hours by putting it in hand or pocket .
the body of samsung galaxy a7 is built on the metal frame , but you will also see glass in the back along with the front .
this is the reason why the company has called it an all-glass body phone .
the site panels of the phone are quite curved , and the finishing is very good .
in such a situation , when taken in hand , it will make you feel very good .
one side sim and card slot has been given in the side panel itself .
the phone has a fingerprint scanner on the power button itself .
such experiment was done by the company with the recently launched galaxy j6 plus .
at the same time , this is the second phone in which the fingerprint scanner has been given on the power button .
the phone &apos;s fingerprint scanner works correctly .
although it is quite small , in such a situation you may have some problems while setting it .
when you want to unlock the phone with fingerprint at once , you have to press a little .
otherwise touch the power button twice then it will be unlocked .
it is right to do so .
because the power button is often pointed at .
in such a situation , the phone will not be unlocked with unwanted touch .
fingerprint scan is fast and works correctly .
while going to the previous panel , there will be three camera sensors in the vertical design and below that there is a flash .
in the middle is the logo of samsung , the rest of the panel is empty and clean .
the body is so shiny that you can use it like a mirror .
we liked the overall mix design .
samsung galaxy a7 ( 2018 ) has been introduced by the company with a 6-inch screen with 18.5 : 9 aspect ratio .
the bezels in the phone are quite low , on the side there are absolutely no while the top and bottom will be slightly visible .
for better display quality , the company has used super amoled panels which are often seen in samsung mid and high range phones .
the display of the phone is quite vibrant and it also has a very good feel during video and gaming .
like the galaxy note and the galaxy s series , you will also get always on display in the samsung galaxy a7 .
at the same time , it can be said that the screen of the phone is gorilla glass protected .
that is , it will protect from minor scratches .
despite the big screen , the phone easily comes in the palm and if you leave only the top part , then you will be able to use the whole screen with one hand .
you will not get any complaints from the design and display of the phone .
lenovo &apos;s 9 : style has power but camera is less
galaxy a7 ( 2018 ) the company has introduced samsung &apos;s own exynos 7885 chipset .
the phone has an octa-core ( 2 × 2.2 ghz cortex-a73 + 6 × 1.6 ghz cortex-a53 ) processor with 14 nanometer fabrication .
along with this , the phone has 64 gb storage with 4 gb ram and 128 gb internal storage of 6 gb ram .
the phone has memory card support and you can use cards up to 512 gb .
it is good that performance is not very good .
this processor is a bit outdated .
in this , you will easily run a game like pabji but will not run on highgraphics .
there was a lack of smoothness .
however , it did not slow down during the experiment and there was no hang-up problem while we also did multitasking and played the game for a long time .
however , whenever you get a little leg .
if you are a music lover , then you will like this phone a lot .
the company has introduced this with dolby atmos integration .
this is best realized on earphones with earphones and a bluetooth headset .
first glimpse of honor 8x : look is not up to par and the feature falls on the redmi note 5 pro
this phone works on experience ui so that the android operating system is based on 8.0 oreo .
the user experience of the phone is easy and you will not face any problem .
apart from google apps in the phone , samsung &apos;s and some amazon apps are also preloaded .
apart from this , the option of daily hunt and secure folder has also been given .
if you wish , you can install third party apps .
the phone has samsung mall and samsung pay mini .
we liked the service like dual messenger in it , where in the phone you can use two facebook and two whatsapp apps simultaneously .
the advantage of this is that you can separate home and office chat .
at the same time , the multiwindows feature is also very good where you can work on two apps simultaneously .
you can also chat with anyone while watching videos or youtube .
overall , we have no complaints about the software .
however , there is no information about whether this phone will update on 9pi .
the most talked about samsung galaxy a7 is and should be its camera .
because in this budget , this is the first phone in which 3 camera sensors have been given .
the main camera sensor of the phone is 24-megapixels .
which comes with f / 1.7 aperture .
it has pdaf support .
this 27  mm sensor is also capable of taking wide angle photos .
the second sensor is 8-megapixels , which comes with f / 2.4 aperture .
this 18 mm sensor will help you in taking an ultra-wide picture .
at the same time , the company has given a 5-mp f / 2.2 aperture depth sensor for bokeh effect and depth sensing .
options like panorama , pro , live focus will be available in the phone .
you can take a picture with a blur background in live focus only .
the good thing can be said that you can adjust the blur before taking the picture in the phone and even after taking the picture .
apart from this , there are also options like slow motion , hyperlaps and ar emoji .
these features were seen only in samsung &apos;s flagship phones till now .
even in wide angle , this phone takes photos with a lot of detailing .
the thing is good about camera quality , can not say very good .
we were expecting a lot more from this phone with three cameras .
although the detailing of the phone is good , but we encountered some problem in color combination .
was slightly different from reality .
pictures looked a bit dull .
takes great pictures during the day .
we also liked the wide angle .
yes , if you compare the phone with this price range , it will prove to be no less than anyone .
turning to the selfie camera , the company has introduced it with a 24-megapixel front camera .
the beautification mode is the default .
you can only change the option .
such as : apart from smart beauty , you can choose options like skin , face , eye and pro lighting .
bokeh effect can be used with the front camera .
selfie also will not disappoint you .
overall , the camera is effective if seen .
yes , due to having 3 sensors , hope is increased but still it is fine .
data and connectivity
the samsung galaxy a7 has dual 4g volte support .
at the same time , there will also be an option of direct video calling .
speaking of slots , you can use a microsd card with two nano sims .
along with this , wifi , bluetooth and nfc will also be available in the phone .
the phone has microusb 2.0 for data and charging .
it would have been better if usb were type-c .
for power backup , samsung galaxy a7 ( 2018 ) has a battery of 3,300 mah .
although today phones with 4,000 mah battery are available in this budget , but still they will not disappoint you .
to increase the battery performance , the company has given a battery saver app which closes the app without any work .
of phonewith the supplied charger , it is fully charged in about one and a half hours .
at the same time , once charged , it is able to take a full day .
in the indian market , this phone is rs 23,990 ( 4 gb ) and 27,990 ( 6 gb ) .
with this , the company is being given a cash back of up to rs 2,000 .
ऐसे में प ् राइस को लेकर आप ज ् यादा शिकायत नहीं कर सकते ।
the samsung galaxy a7 is quite stylish to watch and the built quality is also great .
the phone &apos;s triple camera not only adds to the feature but also improves the wide angle and bokeh effect .
battery backup is also good .
at the same time , you will not get any special complaint from ram and memory , only if the processor was slightly better , it would be called more brilliant .
despite this , if you want a stylish phone and a strong camera phone , then you can take this phone
the smartphone has come out of people &apos;s palm and now comes on the wrist as a &apos; smart watch &apos; .
connected with the smartphone , this watch also acts as a fitness band and maintains the user &apos;s style very well .
likewise , a combo of style and smartness has brought a watchout wearable .
the company has introduced a smart watch model named &apos; desert storm &apos; in the indian market .
seeing whether this watch is equally smart to use , we tried to know and used it continuously for about a week .
we have written the results that came during the use of this review .
first of all , talk about the design of smartwatches , you will like this watch in the first look .
the brown color leather band in the watch gives a unisex look i.e. boys or girls can tie it on their wrist .
the smartwatch has a 44.5 × 44.5 × 12.2  mm size dial that comes with a silver frame .
the screen is black and has a brown color band .
overall the look is quite attractive .
the hole in the band is able to fit every size wrist .
the weight of this device is only 70 grams , so it will not feel too heavy .
to the right of the doyle is the power button which also serves as the home button during use .
there is a heart rate sensor below the dial , which remains in touch with the user &apos;s wrist .
a charging port is also provided with a heart rate sensor on the back panel .
the company has given a magnetic charger .
there is a little upside-down loudspeaker on the back panel so you can talk to it only if you want .
if you buy it , then the color of the watch band can be chosen according to your choice .
it &apos;s a good thing .
the watchout wearable &apos;s desert storm smartwatch features a 1.22-inch round ips display that supports 240 x 240 pixel resolution . the display is quite vibrant and the contrast is also good .
for this reason , the options of the menu are also attractive as well as clock needles .
there is an option to control display in the settings of the watch .
in the round shape dial , the main display of the watch is cropped from the bottom .
it looks like the moon has been chopped down .
although we liked this style .
but this cropped part causes problems in the processing and menu of the watch .
processing and connection
desert storm smartwatch is equipped with 64 mb ram memory by watchout wearable .
this smartwatch has 128 mb of internal storage which saves apps and themes .
for processing , it has been given mediatek &apos;s mt2502c-arm7 chipset and it runs on the smartphone watchout system .
its poor hardware reduces usability after good design .
lags will be visible during use .
we were expecting at least 512 mb ram and 4 gb memory .
the mediatek smart device app can also be used to connect smartwatches to smartphones .
at the same time , the company has also introduced the fundu wear app for smartphones and smartphone connections .
yes , we can say that it is capable of connecting to both ios and android devices .
this smartwatch is capable of connecting to android operating system 4.3 or above and ios 7 and above .
once this smartwatch is connected , you will be able to access the contacts , calendar and messages of the smartphone while it is in sync .
we did not have to work very hard to connect the smartwatch to our phone .
it is fully ready for use in a few minutes .
ui and os
the watchout wearable &apos;s desert storm smartwatch has two user interfaces .
shortcut is present in the main menu to change the ui .
smartwatch has 3 themes from bydefault company but users can download unlimited themes from watchout wearable &apos;s official website for absolutely free .
the desert storm smartwatch works solely on the touch panel but the touch response was not very smooth .
many times this watch does not catch the touch of your finger and has failed to understand the direction of finger motion .
the main menu can be moved to different pages only by scrolling and due to poor touch sensitivity , the user will have trouble opening an app .
however , motion features have also been provided in smartwatches for users who use touch less .
this includes wakeup gestures , shaking switch main menu and shake to answer call .
fitness apps
watchout wearables have given options like pedometer , sleep monitoring , heart rate and sedentary in their smartwatches .
the sensor below the smartwatch dial tells the user &apos;s heart rate .
the pedometer counts the steps taken by the user and tells the distance traveled and calories burned accordingly .
the watchout wearable &apos;s desert storm smartwatch is counting the foot stapes correctly , but very often it also counts the hand movements of the sitting sitting in the foot straps .
at the same time , through sleep monitor , you can also know the quality of your sleep after a day &apos;s fatigue .
entertainment apps
desert storm smartwatch bluetooth music and bluetooth camera app .
after syncing the smartwatch to your phone , the phone &apos;s music app and camera can be operated from the smartwatch itself .
with the change of the volume of the songs playing in the phone from the smartwatch itself , the songs can be played , paused and next .
at the same time , through the bluetooth camera app , you can click in the smartwatch and click the photo from the phone &apos;s camera .
this app can prove to be of great use in group selfies .
yes , we encountered a problem with the use of the bluetooth camera app when connecting this smartwatch to the iphone .
clicking the camera feature , it was changing the phone &apos;s ringer volume .
phone features and features in battery
watchout wearable desert storm smartwatch such as notifications , phonebook , message , dial , call log , calendar , alarm , voice memory , stop watch , calculator and clock are given .
all these features of the phone can be accessed with the smart watch when synced with the smartphone .
at the same time , 300 mah battery has been provided in this smartwatch for power backup .
the battery of the smartwatch is on full charge for about 10 hours without playing music .
but let us tell you that battery backup depends on the use of the smartwatch .
let us know that the watchout wearables have not supported &apos; notifications &apos; to motorola smartphones .
similarly , you will not be able to use text messages in apple iphone .
but in the iphone , messages from whatsapp , instagram and gmail appear in the smartwatch as notifications .
remember you can only read , not reply .
the fit or
felt desert storm smartwatch is listed on the watchout wearable &apos;s website with a price of rs 5,999 which is available for sale on ecommerce site amazon india .
is no doubt that desert storm is ahead of the smartwatch look and style , but at this price , a smart user using a smartwatch would like to have no compromise with the style as well as the processing .
there are a lot of options in smartphones , but there is a lack of smooth touch to use them .
in the same way , the fault coming in the pedometer in the name of full stapes for fitness , somewhere prevents users from relying on the results of harrett , sleep monitoring and sedentary .

lenovo has launched its phones again in the indian smartphone market after almost a year &apos;s silence .
the company has simultaneously launched two phones lenovo k9 and lenovo a5 .
this is seen as a return to the company .
although lenovo launched some phones under its sub brand motorola , but lenovo phones have come after a long time .
in such a situation , everyone wants to know whether this return of the company will be effective or will remain a part of the crowd .
लॉन ् च के साथ ही लेनोवो के9 हमारे पास भी उपलब ् ध हुआ और हमनें कुछ समय के लिए इसका उपयोग भी किया ।
whatever result was found during this period is in front .
looking at the design of lenovo &apos;s 9 , it can be said that this lenovo phones have completely changed .
where previously the company used to bring phones with metal and polycarbonate bodies , this time the glass design has been used .
the body of the phone is built on the metal frame but both front and back have 2.5d curved glass which gives a better quality feel .
due to the 2.5d curved glass , the edges are curved and feel very comfortable to hold .
the rear panel has a dual camera and flash in horizontal style .

dual cameras and soft flash will also be seen on the front panel .
overall , the design is appreciated .
this phone is quite stylish .

the lack of design can only be said that due to the shiny body there are fingerprints .
but this problem is with all glass body phones , in such a situation , it cannot be considered big .
techno camon i2x review : stylish look and better performance but the camera does disappoint .
lenovo k9 uses a flower view display with 18 : 9 aspect ratio .
company has given a 5.7-inch hd + screen with 720 x 1440 pixels resolution .
this range mainly consists of phones with hd + resolution .
the display of the phone is quite vibrant and the touch is also very smooth but the company has not given information about screen protection .
at the same time , in the trend of today &apos;s bezel-less trend , this phone has slightly more bezels on the top and bottom of the screen .
however , we did not find much problem with it .
because of the compact design , you can use the entire screen with one hand .
lenovo k9 has been introduced by the company on mediatek &apos;s mt6762 helio p22 chipset with 12 nanometer fabrication .
the phone has a 2.0 ghz cortex-a53 octa-core processor .

lenovo &apos;s 93 gb ram and 32 gb memory variant is available .
the phone has microsd card support and you can use cards up to 256 gb .
however , keep in mind that the second slot is hybrid , so one has to use either the sim or the card .
talking about performance , this chipset of mediatek is used in mid-range phones and it is simple in terms of performance .
that is , you can easily handle the work of the deli , but you will face problems in heavy games .
this phone works on android operating system 8.1 oreo .
although some customization will be seen in the phone , but to a large extent will make you feel similar to the stock .
yes the apps icon looked a bit big .
the phone has some preloaded apps that are a bit outdated .
the good thing is that you can uninstall them if you want .
the phone is easy to use and new users will not have any problem .
talking about photography segment , lenovo k9 has dual front camera along with dual rear .
two 13-megapixel and 5-megapixel camera sensors have been provided on both the back and front panels of the phone .
the camera setup of both has been equipped with flash light for better photography .
the phone has options like bokeh effect and panorama .
the matter of camera quality is simple .
indoor photography is particularly average .
it takes better photos outdoors where there is good light .
lenovo k9 is a dual sim phone that comes with 4g volte .
with this , wifi , bluetooth and gps will also be available .
the company has given micro usb port for data transfer and charging .
at the same time , it can be said that the lower panel has a loudspeaker .
in such a situation , the voice is not suppressed .
there is a fingerprint scanner for security that works accurately .
we did not face any problem here .
this phone comes with a 3,000 mah battery .
although larger batteries are used today , it may take a little less , but battery backup is good and takes a full day off when fully charged .
huawei nova 3i first glance : this phone will not be lost from this phone
lenovo k9 is priced at rs 8,999 in the indian market and it is available for sale on online store flipkart .

techno recently launched the camon i2x .
through this phone , techno has entered the country &apos;s notch display segment .
this phone is equipped with a notch display as well as the best selfie camera and dual rear camera .
in this budget , the camon i2x equipped with so many features and specifications is attracting the attention of indian users .
seeing the eagerness of the users towards the phone , we also used this phone for more than a week and knew the &apos; x factor &apos; of this phone .
our review presented next will be helpful to tell you whether this phone is a fit in budget and a hit in performance .
the camon i2x is introduced by techno on a glossy body , which looks attractive .
there is no physical button on the front panel .
while the three sides of the phone are completely bezel-less , the light bezel will be seen at the bottom .
the notch on the front panel has speaker , led light and selfie camera sensor .
the bottom panel of the phone has a speaker grill .
along with this , usb port and 3.5 mm jack have also been provided .
the front panel of the phone is as shiny as its back panel is equally glossy .
a vertical rear camera setup is provided in the vertical shape in the left corner on the back panel and a fingerprint sensor is present on the back panel .
despite the low price , it gives a premium look to the phone itself .
techno camon i2x has been introduced on the big screen with 19 : 9 aspect ratios .
the phone has a 6.2-inch screen with 1500 x 720 pixel resolution .
due to the large display size , there is no problem in watching videos or playing games in the phone .
the notch will appear on the screen .
normally , the nokia display that is launched these days , the size of the nokia is small but the size of the nokia in the camon i2x is slightly larger .
like other camon series of techno phones , it also has an outdoor mode and eye care mode that keeps the brightness of the phone clear in the sun and soft and smooth in the dark .
that is , whether it is night chatting or afternoon gaming , this condition will give a great viewer experience and will also protect the eyes .
despite having a large display , the camon i2x can be used easily , the entire display of the phone is accessed with a single hand .
at the same time , if any such problem comes , the company has also given one-hand mode and multi-window mode in it .
techno camon i2x has been introduced on android 8.1 oreo based hios .
let me tell you that this is the latest user interface of the highos version so far .
not much different from the old ui though .
apps like phone freezer , boost and clean have been provided in the phone , which also keeps the applications that are not used for a long time in sleep mode and saves the ram of the phone .
high group options like file manager , opera news and phx browser are preloaded .
one of the preloaded apps in the phone is also the fouveau app which through ai technology keeps analyzing the usage of the phone used by the users throughout the day and inspects the notifications of the app or the content being browsed in the internet .
for social media , it has preloaded social networking apps like facebook , facebook messenger , whatsapp and instagram .
the same theme across all phones keeps the camon i2x the same as the company &apos;s old phone .
there is nothing new in the software and user interface , which would be considered a drawback .
because today &apos;s smartphone users will not refrain from &apos; boring &apos; by seeing the same ui and theme .
this phone comes with 4 gb ram memory .
with this , 64 gb of internal storage has been provided , which can be increased through microsd card .
this phone runs on the mediatek mt 6762 helio p22 chipset and has a 2.0 ghz octa-core processor .
jugalbandi of strong ram and processor has kept the phone &apos;s processing fast .
while playing games like pubg in the phone , we did not have any problem like hanging or lag .
during heavy graphics use and during high-speed chasing in the game , the phone has done a smooth job , but the problem of lagging the phone starts to appear when playing continuously .
the company has also given the game boost app gaming for gaming enthusiasts , which gives color vibrancy to the game graphics and provides good experience .
techno camon i2x has been launched by the company with ai camera setup .
this phone supports dual rear camera .
a 13-megapixel primary camera with f / 1.8 aperture and a 5-megapixel secondary camera sensor with f / 2.4 aperture have been given on the back panel .
rear camera setup is equipped with quad led flash for good photos in low light .
like the hit camera setup design from apple iphone , the rear camera setup of this phone is also given in the vertical shape on the right side on the back panel .
at the same time , a 16-megapixel camera sensor with f / 2.0 aperture has been given on the front panel of the phone for selfie .
to take bright selfies in low light , the company has also equipped the front camera with led flash .
talking about the camon i2x rear camera , the picture quality is good .
there are also phones of realme and honor in this budget, which are known for excellent photography, but this phone of techno keeps the female to compete in their camera segment.
the hdr mode of the phone is good and led light enhances the brightness of the photo at night .
although the photo taken with zoom has seen pixelation problem , at the same time the boca effect also has not gone above the average .
photo mode , video , beauty and panorama modes are available with the rear camera .
while in beauty mode , photos can be made smooth and attractive , the filters in photo mode are quite creative and interactive .
talking about selfie camera , first let us know that the beauty mode present in camon i2x will enhance your selfie .
there are many attractive filters in the phone which make the selfie interactive .
the selfie of camon i2x taken in all the three environments : sun , indoor and night has been good .
here we have not seen the problem of pixelation even when zooming the photo , but the liquidity is seen more in the photo taken with boca effect .
at the same time , this mode also fails to capture the details of the object completely .
in the selfie camera itself , you will get beauty and panorama modes along with videos and photos .
connectivity and security
features such as bluetooth , wifi and gps are available in the camon i2x .
it is a 4g phone that provides fast internet access .
there is a sim tray on the left panel of the phone , in which 2 different sim cards and a microsd card can be inserted simultaneously .
talking about security , a fingerprint sensor has been given on the back panel of the phone , which unlocks the phone quickly as soon as the finger is touched .
if you are changing a setting in the phone , then there is also a fingerprint sensor handy .
along with this , the camon i2x also supports face unlock .
like the rear fingerprint sensor , the face unlock feature of the phone is also great .
the techno camon i2x has been introduced by the company on a powerful battery of 3,750 mah .
the company has not provided any fast charging support in the phone , so the battery charges at an average speed .
it has taken us more than a quarter and a half hour to charge the phone 10 percent to 100 percent .
at the same time , the camon i2x will remove your entire office hour comfortably once it is fully charged .
yes , if you want to watch a video on the way home from the office , then it has to be charged twice a day .
the standby capacity of the battery is good and without playing games , this phone removes 24 hours comfortably in just chatting etc .
on the other hand , in the video loop test , the camon i twin has given a backup of around 14 hours in full charge .
techno has launched the camon i2x at a price of rs 12,499 .
the camon i2x is great in look and design .
the glossy panel of the phone and the notch on the display makes the phone attractive .
despite having a dual rear camera , photography has not proved to be much special .
processing is also fine and battery backup is also better .
fans of camon i2x techno will surely like it .
but its upside for any common smartphone users , paying rs 12,499 and taking the camon i2x may be a bit expensive .
the latest players of this budget can prove to be stiff competition for realme 2 and brands like xiaomi , motorola and honor .
techno tier 2 can be a good option in cities , but it can also lag behind big cities and online shopping segments .
huawei brand honor has introduced honor 8x in the indian market .
this phone is an upgraded version of honor 7x , launched last year .
since honor 7x was proved to be a great device , there is a similar hope for the new honor 8 x.
with the launch , this phone became available to us and first of all we are presenting it with the first glimpse .
it is important to tell you here that after a few hours of use , it has been written , so you have not given any decision on the camera and performance etc .
looking at the design , you can say that it is the smartest looking phone in this range .
the phone is very stylish .
the body of the phone is made on the metal frame but the rear panel is of glass .
earlier , we have seen this kind of design in other devices including honor 9 lite and 9n .
yes , it can be said that the company has also used 2.5d curved glass in the previous panel , so you will find it quite comfortable .
samsung galaxy note 9 review :
it gets smaller and slips by hand due to the improved note glass .
company has used 15 layered glasses in it .
the recently launched honor phone saw a gradual color backpanel , using two different colors .
although its rear panel is of the same color , the company has used double textured glass which gives a different effect .
looking at the phone , it can be said that you will like it at first sight .
although fingerprints were still falling on the body , the cover would have to be used .
samsung galaxy j6 + review : despite the great look and strong features , the simple performance
honor 8x is the biggest display phone of the company till date .
the phone has a 6.51-inch full hd + screen , which is available with a full view 2.0 display with 19.5 : 9 aspect ratio .
the company has used the notch screen .
the phone &apos;s notch is quite small .
the best thing that we found is that it is quite compact despite the big screen .
the reason for this is at least the bezel .
the bottom and top bezels in the phone are quite low .
the phone &apos;s screen to body ratio is 91 percent .
that is , apart from the screen on the main panel , not much will be seen .
the thing is that the screen coating has its own coating , which is not known much .
the phone display is quite good and the touch response is also smooth .
one can see things clearly on the screen even in bright light .
at the same time , the company has said that there is an comfort mode in honor 8x which is certified by tuv rehnland technology .
the company claims that this technology protects your eyes from dangerous blue light not only at night but also in day .
honor 8x works on huawei &apos;s kirin 710 chipset and has an 2.2 ghz clock speed octa-core processor .
it is a new processor and has been seen in huawei nova 3i so far .
the company has introduced it with 4 gb + 64 gb storage , 6 gb + 64 gb storage and 6 gb ram + 128 gb storage .
the phone has memory card support up to 400 gb .
we cannot say much about performance right now because we have not used it but the beginning was fine .
the honor 8x works on the emotion ui 8.5 , which is based on the android operating system 8.1 oreo .
some of huawei &apos;s own apps are preloaded in phones , besides there will not be much bloatware .
honor 8x has a 20-megapixel + 2-megapixel dual camera with f / 1.8 aperture .
there is ai integration with the camera where it automatically enhances the photo .
the company claims that for this , a data base of more than 500 scenes has been prepared in 22 categories .
the phone has options for boke effect , panaroma mode , hdr , nide mode and slow motion video .
you can adjust the focus even after doing photography .
for selfies , the company has given a 16-megapixel front camera and you can use the bokeh effect in the selfie camera as well .
दोहरा सिम आधारित आॅनर 8एक ् स में 4जी वोएलटीई के अलाव , वाईफाई ब ् लूटूथ भी मिलेगा ।
at the same time there is a fingerprint scanner in the rear panel for security , while it also supports face unlock .
the 8x has three card slots where you can use a memory card in addition to two sim cards .
yes , it can be said that it has micro usb 2.0 support .
this phone comes with 3,750 mmh battery .
the company says that it has intelligent power saving technology which improves battery performance up to 33 % .
in the indian market , the model of honor 8x with 4 gb + 64 gb storage is available for rs 14,999 .
at the same time , for 6 gb + 64 gb , you have to pay rs 16,999 .
at the same time , the price of 6 gb ram + 128 gb is rs 18,999 .

in august , samsung launched its much-awaited phone galaxy note 9 .
this phone is very smart and there is no comparison to its note feature .
at the same time , in september , world-renowned apple has launched three phones in the iphone 10s series .
in such a situation , obviously everyone will compare apple and note and you will also want to know which phone is good .
however according to me samsung galaxy note 9 is better than iphone 10s in many respects .
next we have mentioned 10 reasons that make the samsung galaxy note 9 better than the iphone 10s .
1 . display resolution : the samsung galaxy note 9 features a 6.4-inch super amoled screen with an 18.5 : 9 aspect ratio .
like note 8 , the company has also used curved display in it .
the phone &apos;s screen resolution is qhd + display .
the phone &apos;s screen resolution is quad hd 1440 x 2960 pixels .
the screen is corning gorilla glass 5 coated and is hdr 10 compatible .
this phone supports 516 pixel density .
apple iphone has a 5.8-inch super retina oled full hd + display with 2436 x 1125 pixels resolution , which is available with the nokia .
this phone is available with 19.5 : aspect ratio and its pixel density is 458 . the company has used hdr display with 1 million to 1 contrast ratio which gives you a great viewing experience .
however , you can also experience here that the galaxy note 9 is not only ahead of pixel resolution but is also better than apple in terms of pixel density .
pictures will look sharper in this .
2 . aspen : it is important to mention s pen first .
samsung &apos;s note series is known for its excellent aspen integration and the pen of the galaxy note 9 has become even smarter .
you can use it as a report .
many options like note making , off screen note , smart note air command come with it .
you will not find any of these in apple .
3 . samsung dex : although the information of this feature will be less to the people , but let me tell you that this is a very powerful feature of samsung .
you can use your phone as a computer .
yes , it requires a usb type c cable with hdmi port .
through this , you will connect with any screen of the phone and the entire menu of the phone will come to that screen .
you can use the galaxy note 9 with full accessories including keybods and mouse whereas apple does not have any such features .
4 . battery : in galaxy note 9 you will get 4,000 mah battery .
it supports wireless charging as well as fast charging .
this is the biggest battery note phone of the company till date .
at the same time , apple does not provide battery information , but according to the information given on the internet , 2,658 mah battery has been given in the iphone 10s .
5 . physical dual sim : this time there is a lot of discussion about dual sim of iphone .
but let me tell you that the phone has the same physical sim , while the second slot is of the isim .
airtel and reliance jio are currently offering isim services in india .
at the same time , isim service is not being considered very good right now .
speaking of samsung , you will get a dual sim slot in the galaxy note , you can use two physical sims simultaneously .
6 . headphone jack : the company has not provided a headphone jack in the iphone 10s .
you will only be able to use wireless earphones or headphones in the phone .
at the same time last year , there was a lightning connector with sales pack , which has been removed this time .
as far as the samsung galaxy note 9 is concerned , in this phone you will get a 3.5- mm audio jack .
you can use any earphone .
7 . ram : samsung galaxy note 9 is far ahead of iphone in terms of ram .
the 128 gb variant of the galaxy note 9 has 6 gb ram memory , while the 512 gb memory variant is available with 8 gb ram .
at the same time , apple never gives the information of ram , but according to the news , the iphone 10s has 4 gb ram memory , which is much less than the note 9 .
8 . memory : samsung galaxy note 9 comes in 128 gb and 512 gb memory variant .
at the same time , this phone also has memory card support .
you can use a microsd card up to 512 gb .
apple iphone 10s is available in 64 gb , 256 gb and 512 gb memory .
it does not have the option of 128 gb .
if you want to get the initial model , then you have to be satisfied with 64 gb only .
at the same time , as you know , the memory card is not supported in the iphone , so you have to rely only on the internal memory of the phone .
9 . fingerprint scanner : there is no doubt that the apple iphone 10s has very good face recognition .
but let me tell you that there are no other advance options in this security .
pin / password or face recognition will have to be trusted .
there is no fingerprint scanner or irish scanner .
at the same time , in addition to face recognition and pin / password in samsung galaxy note 9 , irish scanner and fingerprint scanner will also be available .
the phone also has a heart rate sensor .
10 . price : the last but most important thing is the difference in price of both phones .
the 128 gb memory variant of samsung galaxy note 9 is priced at rs 67,900 .
at the same time , a phone with 512 gb memory is available for rs 84,900 .
the phone with 64 gb memory variant of apple iphone 10s is available for rs 99,900 while the phone with 256 gb memory can be taken for rs 1,14,900 .
if you want to take a phone with 512 gb memory then you have to pay rs 1,34,900 .
at the same time , if you are thinking of taking the larger version of the iphone 10s iphone 10s max , then its starting price is rs 1,09,900 while the 512 gb model is rs 1,44,900 .
that is , there is a difference of about 32,000 rupees between the initial model of galaxy note 9 and the initial model of apple iphone 10s .
in such a situation , you can think for yourself which phone is better for you .
it was discussed for a long time that samsung is making its android go phone and it may be launched soon .
it was just getting news that suddenly there was news that the company has launched the galaxy j2 core in india , which is available for sale for rs 6,190 .
as it is known , android go is a light operating system made by google , which is capable of providing better android experience even in phones with less specification .
when the company launched this phone , it also claimed that not only will you get the experience of the new android operating system , but you can also enjoy the fast users experience .
in such a situation , when samsung galaxy j2 core came into our hands , during the review , we also tried to check whether this phone is really fast or the claim will be left only on paper .
after a few days of usage , my attitude about the phone is written in further detail .
today phones with bezel less design are in trend but in samsung galaxy j2 core you will get to see simple smartphone design .
in such a situation , at first glance it will not impress you much but when you take it in hand it will make you feel its quality .
the body of the phone is made of polycarbonate plastic and the company has used metallic back cover .
it will make you feel good .
the compact design of the phone easily fits into the palm .
however , the special thing can be said that its back panel opens and you can change the battery yourself .
there is a sim and memory card slot inside the cover itself .
after a long time we saw the phone whose back panel is opening .
the back panel of the phone has a camera with flash and the company logo below .
on the front panel , there is a camera above the screen and a samsung logo on the bottom .
overall , it is good to talk about built quality and you will also like the phone .
today , even in the low range , full view display is trending , despite its company has introduced the galaxy j2 core with 16 : 9 aspect ratios .
the phone has a 5.0-inch screen with 540 x 960 pixel resolution .
looking at the screen resolution , you can say that at least hd would have been better .
however , as is known , samsung has always been known for the bright display , so in this case , this phone will not disappoint you and will not miss the lack of hd screen .
on the other hand , it can be said that the screen of the phone is coated with corning gorilla glass which not only gives strength to the screen but also protects it from minor scratches .
however the company has not revealed the gorilla glass version .
the touch feel of the phone is very good and you will not miss any kind .
as is known , this is samsung &apos;s go edition phone .
in this , you will not get the specifications very strong , but the ui of the phone will get fast and it will also be updated .
the samsung galaxy j2 core works on the exynos 7570 and has a 1.4 ghz cortex-a53 quadcore processor .
along with this is the mali-t720 gpu .
the phone has been provided with 1 gb ram power and with 8 gb internal memory .
out of this , about 5 gb of data is available to the user .
although after seeing the specification you can complain about ram and memory , but the special thing can be said that in the phone &apos;s memory card , you can install apps in addition to documents and media files .
the thing is that with less ram , you will not miss it anywhere during everyday use . it is able to handle small apps and games easily .
yes , if you are thinking of playing big heavy games , then there may be some problem .
the game starts late or may get lag in between .
however during the experiment we installed a game with heavy graphics like asphalt 8 and it was playing .
apart from this , it was handling other tasks including browsing better .
the samsung galaxy j2 core works on the android operating system 8.1 , in which you will see the oreo go edition .
good thing can be said that it will get os updates even further .
it will be upgraded soon on arthata 9 pie .
however , despite the google go integration , it will get a glimpse of the samsung experience .
in addition to google go , file go and youtube go , features like go assistant will be available in the phone .
along with this , some samsung apps will also appear .
the interface of the galaxy j2 core is extremely easy and if you are a new smartphone user then there will be no problem .
all three control buttons will be found on the screen itself and above are the favorites and shortcuts .
however , during the movie and game the control buttons are hidden , so you will be able to use the full screen .
you can open the menu by swiping from the bottom up .
if you swipe down from the top of the screen , you will get quick access .
you can edit the quick access according to your needs .
budget is high or less , you always want strong camera in the phone .
the samsung galaxy j2 core is also good here .
the phone has an 8-megapixel rear camera .
the camera is accompanied by auto focus support and is with f / 2.2 aperture .
there will also be hdr and panorama modes .
as far as picture quality is concerned , it was getting a bit pixelated in the indoor , which is common in phones in this range , but it was doing very good photography in the out door .
picture details were very good and they were not bursting even on 2x zoom .
for video , this phone is capable of recording at a frame rate of 30 frames per second at 1080 pixel resolution .
for the selfie , it has a 5-megapixel front camera with f / 2.2 aperture .
the selfie camera of the phone is good but cannot say it very well .
takes good pictures in good light but was slightly pixelated in low light .
below is a sample picture taken from the samsung galaxy j2 core .
you can guess yourself how good the picture is .
while we have compressed it a lot .
samsung galaxy j2 core is a real dual sim phone .
that is , one can use a microsd card with two sim slots in the phone .
4g volte can be availed in the phone and wifi bluetooth is also available .
during the experiment we connected different wifi many times and was connecting quite easily .
apart from this , hotspots and gps have also been provided .
there is nothing said in this segment .
for power backup this phone has a battery of 2,600 mamch and you believe battery backup is very good .
once in charge , it gives off a full day of rest even after continuous use .
while we played games in it , also did photography and also used the internet .
after seeing everything , when it comes to give the final decision , it can be said that the phone is good and is much better for those who want to shift from a feature phone to an android phone .
the ui of the phone is good , the built quality is great , the camera is good and the battery backup also does not disappoint .
yes , the processing is a bit simple .
if you talk about the price , then this phone is fine for rs 6,190 , but if the price was a little lower then it would have been called the best .
samsung has launched two new smartphones simultaneously , increasing its galaxy j series in the indian smartphone market .
the galaxy j6 plus and galaxy j4 plus have been launched in the market by the company .
while the galaxy j6 + will be available for sale at a price of rs 15,990 , the galaxy j4 + can be purchased for rs 10,990 .
with the galaxy j4 plus launched in a cheap budget , samsung has come up with new hopes in the low budget market in the country .
how much samsung &apos;s expectations meet and users will find out later , but the very next day after the launch of the phone , we removed the galaxy j4 + from the box and tested it .
read further how we liked the first impression of samsung galaxy j4 plus i.e. the first glimpse and first use of this phone .
the samsung galaxy j4 plus is built on a glass body with a metal frame .
the phone will come in its first look only because its design is capable of realizing premium quality .
the phone has a bezel-less display with upper and lower body parts present .
there is a selfie camera on one side of the earpiece on the front panel , and flash light on the other side .
there is a light pattern on the glass on the back panel of the galaxy j4 + , this glass gives the phone a tough look on the one hand , while it is perfectly clean and plain when holding the phone in hand .
there is a single rear camera and led flash on the back panel .
as the phones are sharp , due to which a very good grip is created on the phone .
the volume rocker and sim and card tray are given on the left panel of the phone and the power button is given on the right panel .
the display of samsung galaxy j4 + has been introduced at 18.5 : 9 aspect ratios .
the phone has a 6-inch hd + ips lcd infinity display with 1480 x 720 pixels resolution .
the phone &apos;s display is protected with glass .
the display is quite bright and the colors of all the icons present in the phone are sharp .
the galaxy j4 + display showcases all colors perfectly .
operating system
samsung galaxy j4 plus android operating system has been introduced on 8.1 oreo .
there is no layer of ui done in the phone , you will get to see the user friendly theme of samsung galaxy .
the phone has a bixbe .
at the same time , samsung has introduced this phone by preloading apps like samsung mall , samsung pay mini as well as dailyhunt , amazon .
at the same time , only facebook will be seen in the phone in the name of social networking apps .
the galaxy j4 plus has an 1.4 ghz clock speed octa-core processor with which this phone runs on qualco mm &apos;s snapdragon 425 chipset .
in the first use , no lag or hang of any kind appeared in the phone .
the rest of the phone &apos;s processing capability will be tested after a little use and playing the game .
samsung galaxy a7 , launched with triple rear camera and 24 mp selfie camera , is very powerful this phone has
a 13-megapixel rear camera sensor with f / 1.9 aperture with led flash on the back panel of samsung galaxy j4 plus .
at the same time , this phone supports 5-megapixel front camera for selfie .
selfie cameras have been provided with stickers and filters , while beauty mode and pro mode are also available with the rear camera .
the results of both the back and front camera have been average .
at the same time , the blur effect of the phone is also not very good , but it can be called fine .
the company has launched the galaxy j4 plus with 2 gb ram memory .
the phone has 16 gb of internal storage which can be expanded up to 512 gb via microsd card .
samsung is bringing 'galaxy p' series, phones with in-display fingerprint sensor will be launched
this samsung phone supports dual sim .
while the company has given separate slots for sim 1 , sim 2 and microsd card can be inserted simultaneously in the other slot .
that is , if you want to change your second sim or remove the memory card , then sim 1 will not need to be teased and it will remain on the phone .
talking about security , samsung has not given any fingerprint sensor in this phone , which will be called a drawback .
it has face unlock feature for security .
for power backup , samsung galaxy j4 + has a battery of 3,300 mah .
samsung &apos;s battery is considered to be good , but even with how many hours the battery of this phone supports it , it can also be told by using it adequately .
yes , we did not see the problem of heating the phone during charging .
samsung has launched the galaxy j4 plus at a price of rs 10,990 .
this phone can be purchased from online retail stores as well as online retail stores .
in this price range , the galaxy j4 plus will compete with redmi and realme 2 .
in this race , this phone will not be able to get ahead but it can be said that it can compete against xiaomi and realme to some extent on the look of it .
samsung has become very aggressive this year after the constant competition from xiaomi in the budget segment .
recently , the company has launched devices such as galaxy a6 , galaxy a6 plus , galaxy j8 and j4 at the offline store .
at the same time , the company has brought a phone like on8 in online .
although in the meantime devices like galaxy note 9 were also launched but the focus has been more on the budget segment and now once again samsung has launched the galaxy j4 + and galaxy j6 + in the indian market .
with the launch , these phones were available for review from us and we have become available with the galaxy j6 + full review .
till now you must have seen samsung &apos;s budget segment phones with polycarbonate and metal body , but this time the company has presented in glass finish .
the glass body was mainly used by the company in premium phones like the galaxy s series and galaxy note series .
but with the galaxy j6 + , the company has started the glass body in the budget segment .
however , where the curved body is used in the flagship phone , the galaxy j6 + has been introduced in the box design .
the glass body is patterned from inside which gives a different effect .
this phone is made on a metal frame .
many times , in box design phones , corners are slightly prickly , but the feel of this phone is different .
the company has used 2.5d curved glass in the front and back .
the glass is fitted in the frame in such a way that nothing seems to be in the hand .
built quality is superb and also very comfortable to hold .
as far as placement of slots is concerned .
the upper panel is completely empty .
the bottom panel has a 3.5 mm audio jack and a micro usb charging port .
the right panel of the phone has a power button with a loudspeaker .
the special thing is that you will get a fingerprint scanner on the power button itself .
we first saw this kind of integration in sony phones , but now samsung has started it in low budget phones .
the phone &apos;s fingerprint scanner is fast and accurate .
at the same time , you also avoid tapping two places .
so we like this new change .
at the same time , the left panel of the phone has a volume rocker , sim slot and microsd card slot .
overall , the style is excellent and after seeing it you can say that it is one of the best looking phones in this segment .
first look of honor 7s : stylish but slightly lacking
samsung galaxy j6 + you will get a 6-inch true hd + infinity display with 1480 × 720 pixels resolution .
company has used bezel lace display with 18.5 : 9 aspect ratio .
the display of the phone is good but according to the kind of display that we have seen in samsung &apos;s phone so far , the brightness level is slightly lower .
the reason for this may be that the company has not used super amoled display this time , the phone has a simple lcd ips display .
however , we do not have much complaint with the display , mainly phones with this specification are available in this range .
this phone works on the qualco mm snapdragon 425 chipset and has a 1.4 ghz quadcore processor .
this can be called the lack of this phone .
in this range , at least you can expect octacore processors .
had the company used snapdragon 600 series chipsets , it would have been better .
the phone has 64 gb internal memory with 4 gb ram .
along with this , there is memory card support up to 512 gb .
during the experiment , we played high graphics games like asphalt 8 and pbg .
it was taking some time to get the game open but there was not much problem in playing .
however , there was a slight lack of smoothness .
during phone usage , we opened several tabs in the browser and also used multitasking .
this phone was doing everything but there was a lack of smoothness .
although there was no hang but there was lag .
this phone works on the android operating system 8.1 oreo and will see samsung experience version 9.5 .
in the phone you can use the split screen .
along with this , samsung pay mini , phone pay and bixby integration will also be seen .
the most important thing that can be said is that in addition to chrome , it will get three options including samsung and opera mini .
at the same time , the best thing about the os can be said that you can install apps in the phone on the card as well .
in samsung galaxy j6 plus you will find many apps preloaded like amazon , netflix , dailyhunt and open news .
you can also uninstall these apps if you want .
in samsung and apple phones , you must have used features like animoji till now .
at the same time , in this phone , the company has given an emotify feature to improve the messaging service , where jiff can send messages with image .
the good thing is that in this jiff image you message yourself in your favorite language .
these zif images are already available in the phone but you can change their look and style .
samsung galaxy j6 + has a dual rear camera .
the phone has a sensor f / 1.9 aperture that comes with 13-megapixels .
the second sensor is 5-megapixel with f / 2.2 aperture .
with the camera , you were given the bokeh effect , which the company has named live focus .
along with this , pro mode and panorama mode will also be available .
the second sensor of the phone is for the depth effect .
speaking of picture quality , the depth mode works well with a single face .
but if there are a lot of objects , then there is a problem .
yes , it clicks the best picture in normal mode .
the details of the outdoor picture are quite good .
at the same time , it cannot be underestimated even in indoor .
low light photography is also good , you cannot remove too many drawbacks .
for selfie , this phone has an 8-megapixel front camera and will get a soft flash with the camera .
at the same time , the company also has a bokeh effect with a single camera , which the company has named selfie focus .
that is , you can take a selfie with a blur backgrand .
the selfie camera of the phone is good , so will not say very good .
soft flash helps in low light .
yes it will not be much beneficial during group selfie .
overall , the photography is good and is very close to reality .
in this display , it will definitely appear a little dull .
as seen nowadays , fm radio has disappeared from smartphones .
this is not the case in this phone .
the company has an fm radio in the phone .
for better music , it has dolby atmos sound integration where you can feel 360 degree surround sound .
the music quality of the phone is good .
samsung galaxy j6 + has dual sim support .
it is a real dual sim phone where one can use a microsd card with two sims .
the phone has 4g volte support and will also get wifi , wifi hotspot and bluetooth .
for power backup , the company has given 3,300 mah battery in this phone .
the battery backup of the phone is good but the charging time is too much .
the samsung galaxy j6 + is priced at rs 15,990 in the indian market .
this phone is available at the offline store .
finally , if you compare the features according to the price , then it can be said that samsung galaxy j6 + is the best looking phone in this range .
the phone &apos;s camera is good and battery backup won &apos;t disappoint either .
at the same time , 4 gb ram and 64 gb memory is also enough .
yes , despite all the goodness , its slow processor makes the phone fun a bit gritty .
the samsung galaxy note series has been around 9 years old .
in such a situation , it can be said that the note has grown not only in age but also in size and there have been many changes as they get older .
the note &apos;s journey , which started with a 5-inch screen , has now come to about 6.5-inches and the aspen features have become amazing .
this is the reason when samsung galaxy note phones are launched .
there are talks about the specification and design of the phone , but not as much as people discuss its aspen .
his reason is clear .
every company launches phones with good specifications , but the note is only with samsung .
many phones came with the stylus but none could match the aspen .
therefore , samsung galaxy note phones are compared to old notes rather than other phones and first of all people talk on the aspen feature .
this time too , the company has launched the galaxy note 9 and it is considered to be a very good phone .
at the same time , with the launch of the phone , the question of people is whether this phone is better than the galaxy note 8 and whether new updates have come .
the samsung galaxy note 9 was also available to us for review and we have tried to answer these questions .
at the same time , both the quality and the weaknesses of the phone have also been mentioned in detail .
will note its style ,
although many reviews have been said so far that there is not much difference in the design of samsung galaxy note 8 and note 9 .
whereas i felt quite a difference .
the company has used a larger screen than the old model but the size of the phone has become smaller .
the samsung galaxy note 8 has a length of 162.5  mm while the galaxy note 9 has a length of 161.9  mm .
yes , this phone has become almost 2  mm wider than the old model , if you have used note 8 , then you will be able to feel it easily .
we have no complaints about the design and quality of the phone .
able to create a premium feel from look to quality .
in the last few years , the premium segment phones of samsung have come with glass body and you will get the same material in samsung galaxy note 9 .
both the front and back panels use curved glass which is quite comfortable .
good thing can also be said that despite the glass panel does not slip much .
we were also surprised that even after the big battery and big screen , it does not feel heavy .
keep it in the pocket or you will not feel uncomfortable in the hand .
the company has introduced the samsung galaxy note 9 with a larger 6.4-inch screen , and it can be said that it is easily accepted even in the ordinary palm .
yes , it would definitely say that with just one hand you will not be able to use the whole screen .
while the galaxy note 8 had a fingerprint placement with a dual camera on the real panel , this time the company has given it below .
despite this , there has not been much change , still you will have to work a little bit in using the fingerprint scanner .
at the same time , the scanner is also a bit smaller , so there may be some problem .
the upper panel of the phone has a sim / microsd card slot , while the bottom panel has a 3.5- mm audio jack , usb type-c port , loudspeaker and aspen .
the side panels have a volume rocker , bixby button and power button .
overall , except for fingerprint scanner placement in the design , everything else is very attractive .
this is the quality you expect from samsung &apos;s flagship phone .
at the same time , curved design of samsung is not equal yet .
samsung galaxy note 9 is ip68 certified .
that is , it gives you the assurance of being a dust and water blocker .
this phone can stay in 1.5 meters of water for 30 minutes .
during the experiment , we washed it in water many times and did photography in the rain and even kept it in water for some time , even then this phone was working properly .
oneplus 6 red edition : this phone became even more beautiful
and grew note
as we have already talked about , this phone has a super-amoled display with 6.4-inch quadhd resolution .
its screen resolution is 1440 x 2960 pixels .
the company has used a bezel-less infinity display with 18.5 : 9 aspect ratios .
the bezel in the phone has reduced even more than before and now the screen covers 83.4 percent of the front panel .
as we have seen earlier , the display of samsung phone is very bright and best .
in samsung galaxy note 9 , you will not find any kind of deficiency .
the special thing can be said that the screen is hdr 10 compatible , ie it will have a better view than an ordinary amoled display .
yes , you may complain that the finger does not go everywhere on the big screen , in such a situation , you can place a lot of shortcuts on the screen as well .
its touch feeling is much better and always on display further enhances its usefulness .
the screen of the phone is corning gorilla glass 5 coated which protects it from scratches and also gives it strength .
aspen is the most notable
the usp of samsung galaxy note series is its aspen and this pen will impress you a lot in this phone too .
this aspen feature has become even better in the new note .
like last year , this year too , the company has been given a tiptop with a tiptop .
though there is no feature on the tiptop , but some new features have been added to the aspen .
now galaxy aspen is equipped with bluetooth and you can use it as a remote .
with aspen , you can enjoy rear and selfie cameras , take photos and play youtube videos .
the camera is turned on by long press , the camera is changed by double press and photo can be taken with a single click .
similarly during youtube videos , one click can be played and paused .
yes , the good thing can be said that if one espen is registered with your phone then no other espen remote will work .
as soon as you install the new aspen in your phone , it will register itself and the old pen will be disconnected .
yes , it can be said that you can open apps remotely but you cannot activate them .
the screen in the galaxy note 9 has pressure sensitive point support , so the screen expectation changes according to the pressure .
at the same time , the phone &apos;s pen is very accurate and at the time of use , you will not realize that you are running aspen , not an ink pen .
when using a pen while writing a note , you can write by touching the hand on the screen , there will be no effect from anywhere .
during the experiment , we made notes and also did a lot of painting , the feeling everywhere was fantastic .
you can change the size and color of the brush from the tip of the pen .
in this , both the plane and ruling pages will be available to you .
like the galaxy note 8 , in the samsung galaxy note 9 , you can also make notes in the off screen .
we had bluepane and in the off screen note it writes yello .
however , you cannot change the color of ink in the off screen .
as soon as you remove the pen in the screen lock , the note feature itself becomes active and you can write directly on the screen .
at the same time , as soon as you hold the pen or turn on the screen , it will ask you to save the note .
you can save or discard .
on any windows , the note feature is turned on as soon as you remove the pen and a wheel will be activated on the front screen and you can use the note feature .
there will be many other features including screen right , smart selection and translate .
if you want , you can also edit the aspen wheel according to your need .
at the same time , you can take a screen shot with the button in the pen .
the note 9 has deriding recognition support and has become even better than before .
at the same time , the company has also made the live message even better .
earlier , in this you could make messages with jiff files by yourself , but now you will get more style and color options of the brush .
along with this , you can change the background during a live message and you can also use enemoji .
the option of translate is also given in air command , by moving aspen on any word or paragraph , you can see the translation at the same time .
although this feature is old but very useful .
in
the case of samsung note experience software , note 9 will not be said to be much different from its old version .
this phone works on android operating system 8.1 oreo which is based on samsung experience 9.5 .
there will be some different layers due to notes and bixby .
there is no hardware button below the screen .
in such a situation , you have to depend on the button given on the screen .
the phone has three android buttons at the bottom of the screen and you can lock the control buttons on the screen or keep it in the swipe drop down .
the fix is ​ ​ to double tap on the three dots next to the navigation button .
at the same time , in addition to the ordinary google apps , you will get the option of galaxy app store , samsung health and samsung pay .
in samsung pay , you can integrate your debit or credit card and pay with just one tab .
at the same time , the use of split screen or multividences feature is not as good as that seen in samsung note and s series phones .
this phone has samsung assistant bixby and also supports vice .
the bixby button is given below the power button in the right panel of the phone .
bixby is the voice support and does quite a lot of work .
however , there is no hindi support yet .
at the same time , for vice assistant , you can also use google vice by pressing the home button for some time .
however buxby does not prove to be very useful in front of google assistant .
note power
as it is known , samsung offers its flagship phone on two chipsets .
one model works on a qualco mm chipset while the other works on exynos .
a model with an exnote chipset is always available in india .
the samsung galaxy note 9 &apos;s indian variant exynos 9810 chipset works .
the phone has two quadcore processors , one is given a 2.7 ghz octa-core processor while the other processor is 1.8 ghz .
the second processor becomes active at high performance .
this time the company has introduced two ram variants of 6 gb and 8 gb .
there is a difference in memory as well .
you will get this phone with 128 gb and 512 gb variants .
at the same time , it can be said that the phone has memory card support up to 512 gb .
as far as performance is concerned , there is no doubt that it is one of the fastest phones at the moment .
you open any number of tabs in the phone simultaneously and play any game does not read any difference .
at the same time , during long time use , we did not get any type of heating problem .
impressive note camera the
samsung galaxy note 9 has been introduced by the company with a 12-megapixel dual rear camera .
the phone has one sensor with f 1.5 / f-2.4 variable aperture while the other sensor is with f 2.4 aperture .
in this , one sensor supports wide angle , while the other telephoto lens has been given .
earlier , we saw the use of variable aperture in its galaxy s9 plus .
the advantage of this is that during photography the phone will take as much live light as is needed .
along with the blur backgrand , it also supports ois .
at the same time , it can be said that the phone has ultraslow motion video recording support .
the camera has 2 x optical zoom and up to 10 x digital zoom .
during ultra slow motion , a space will appear on the screen where it detects itself and shoots slow motion video when there is motion .
portrait mode is named live focus by the company .
where you can take great pictures with blur background .
along with live focus , you will also get dual photo mode .
where it takes two photos at a time .
one is a blur background with zoom and the other in normal mode you can save it as you want .
there is up to 2x optical zoom support with the camera and 10x digital zoom can also be used simultaneously .
there are modes like pro mode , panorama and auto hdr with the camera .
the picture quality of the rear camera is very good and takes a lot of detail photos .
the use of hdr was also excellent .
no matter how much you zoom the picture taken during the day , it will not explode quickly .
at the same time , it takes good photos even during low light at night .
we took the picture even in very low light and it was much better .
wide angle photography was also excellent .
note 9 &apos;s selfie camera is 8-megapixel with f / 1.7 aperture and it supports auto focus .
with the blur background you can take pictures even in selfie mode and it also works very well .
with the camera , it will get bixby vision integration which proves to be very useful for you .
at the same time , even though the 8-megapixel sounds less , but after watching the picture , you will not get any decrease in quality .
its screen flash proves to be very effective in low light and takes the best selfie .
samsung started the animozee picture with the galaxy s9 .
that is , you can make a photo a gif animated photo .
this feature works very well and is also being used a lot during social networking .
overall , it can be said that it is currently the best camera phone of samsung .
in terms of photography , it has the power to challenge the best devices like apple iphone 10s and pixel .
secure note
for security in the phone , from fingerprint sensor , facial recognition and iris scanner to simple password and pattern lock .
we also used these features in the galaxy note 8 but it has become much better than before .
especially face unlock was working very accurately .
yes , there was definitely a shortcoming .
this is the drawback that unlocks the phone even when the eye is closed .
however , the good thing is that if you set up face unlock without glasses and then unlock it using glasses then the phone will not be opened .
it works correctly even in low light .
first it is written above that the fingerprint scan is still up but it works much faster than before .
you can use irish scanner but during use it gets cheated many times and then the pattern-password has to unlock the phone itself .
advance note connectivity
samsung 4g note 9 for data and connectivity with 4g volte , wifi , bluetooth and usb type-c will also be available .
at the same time , the heartrate sensor is also available next to the camera .
for the use of the heartrate sensor , the company has introduced the shealth app in it and we used it and it was working correctly .
although the doctors will believe it or not , it is a different matter , but you can check it in your daily routine .
apart from heart rate , you can check many other things including stress level , excise , food and slip in the health app .
but in the galaxy note 9 it has become quite advanced .
you can tackle your office or personal work only through the phone .
will definitely note the battery
samsung galaxy note 9 has a 4,000 mah battery for power backup .
this is the biggest battery note ever and there is no doubt that the battery backup of the phone has become very good .
once fully charged , the average ejects easily for one and a half days during use .
it charges quite fast with the given charger of the sales pack .
the company has given battery optimization in it and is very beneficial to kill the task .
samsung galaxy note price in the
indian market , the price of 6 gb ram 128 gb memory variant of samsung galaxy note 9 is 67,900 rupees .
at the same time , 8 gb ram and 512 gb memory variant can be purchased for rs 84,900 .
this phone is available both offline and online .
if you buy it with an exchange offer , hdfc card or paytm , you will get an additional rs 6,000 cashback .
in such a situation , this phone will cost you about rs 62,000 .
note the final decision
finally , when it comes to the final decision , looking at the price , specification and features , it can be said that the phone is not cheap but if it is also compared to the galaxy note 8 , then it proves to be better in every respect .
the bigger screen , better processor , bigger memory , bigger battery , upgraded camera , dex features and the new aspen will appeal to you .
not only this , the company has not increased the price compared to last year , note 8 was also launched at rs 67,900 .
at the same time , cashback is also being given more in note 9 .
overall , it is getting cheaper than the launch price of note 8 .
so it can be said that samsung galaxy note 9 is a good deal .
yes , now the apple iphone 10s has been launched , in such a situation , the galaxy note 9 will also be compared to the apple iphone 10s , but this phone remains somewhere ahead in price , features and specifications .
because the 10r , the smallest model of the iphone 10 series , is also more expensive by rs 10,000 than the galaxy note 9 .
in such a situation , if you are thinking of taking a new iphone or one of the galaxy note 9 , then according to me , samsung galaxy note 9 would be a better choice .
last month , huawei introduced honor 9n and honor play under the honor brand .
where the 9n was introduced by the company in the mid-range .
play is on a slightly expensive budget .
now the company has launched the s model in a lesser range .

this phone is available for sale on online store flipkart from today .
with the launch , this phone also became available to us and we have brought its first glimpse for you .
talking about the design of honor 7s , the design pattern of the phone launched by the company in the last few months is very different from that .
except for the honor play , the company has used a glass body in all other phones while the honor 7s body is made of polycarbonate plastic .
however the built quality is good and the compact design gives better grip .
the right panel of the phone has a volume rocker and power button while the left panel has a sim and microsd card slot .
the bottom panel has a charging slot while the upper panel will have an audio jack .
the company has introduced it in unibody design and its design is good , but in this range , xiaomi has metal phones , so you can consider it a little behind .

despite the low price , this phone is available with a full view display with a new 18 : 9 aspect ratio .
the phone &apos;s screen resolution is hd + 1440 × 720 pixels .
although there is not much information about protection but the view is good .

in the phone you will find a 1.5 ghz quadcore processor .

glossy glass will be seen in the front and back of the phone .
the pack panel is so shiny that you can comfortably see your face in it .
although huawei is praised for a design .
the built quality of the phone is excellent and it will make you feel of premium quality when taken in hand .
yes , it is so smooth that there is little fear of slipping , but the sales pack has a silicone cover that protects it .

however , we cannot talk much about performance right now .
speaking of memory , this phone is available in 128 gb memory with 4 gb ram .
the phone has memory card support and you can use cards up to 256 gb , but the second slot is highbridge .
you can use either sim or card .

techno recently introduced &apos; camon eye click &apos; in the indian market which is equipped with 20-mp selfie and 16-mp rear camera .
at the same time , the company has introduced &apos; camon i twin &apos; smartphone .
the word twin in the phone &apos;s name has been used for dual rear cameras .
this is the company &apos;s first smartphone launched in india with a dual rear camera setup .
the camon i twin is priced at rs 11,499 .
in such a situation , it was interesting for us to see whether this phone with a dual camera in the lower range is better in performance or a dual camera just named .
a 13-megapixel primary camera and a 2-megapixel secondary camera sensor have been given on the back panel of the techno camon i twin .
the rear camera setup is in the horizontal shape at the top right on the back panel .
similarly , the 13-megapixel selfie camera has been given on the front panel of the phone .
the flash light is provided with selfie camera and screen flash support is also provided .
if you want , you can turn on the screen flash by turning off the main flash .
talking about the rear camera , here are several attractive filters on photo mode .
along with photo mode , video , beauty and panorama modes are present .
yes , if we talk about quality , we were hoping for something better by looking at the dual camera .
it was blurring the background during the bokeh effect but was not very accurate .
techno camon eye twin has many times failed to understand the difference between the object and the background , and instead of the object &apos;s sharp edge , it appears blurred .
in daylight , hdr mode is brightening photos too much .
the rear flash light of the phone is quite strong which brightens the object well in low light .
but on the other hand , noises are seen in the photographs clicked from the rear camera at night time .
talking about selfie camera , here you will get beauty and panorama mode along with videos and photos .
like the rear camera , the front camera also has portrait mode and many attractive filters .
the photo taken with the front camera is quite good .
people fond of beauty filters and portrait mode selfies present in the phone may like it a lot .
the result of click photos from the front camera is excellent , which captures the details of the object well .
however , here too , there is a significant difference in photos captured in hdr and non-hdr modes .
portrait mode is good in selfie camera , but sometimes it also messes up the object &apos;s outline .
the camon eye twin is offered by techno on a polycarbonate body .
the dimensions of the phone are 160.4 × 76.3 × 8.5  mm .
talking about the front panel , there is no physical button here .
the front panel has a speaker facing upwards , with led light on one side and a selfie camera sensor on the other side .
this techno phone is very light in weight .
the back panel is not very smooth , so it does not slip from the palm without a cover .
overall the design is clean and good .
techno camon i twin has been introduced on the big screen with 18 : 9 aspect ratios .
the screen size of the phone is 6-inch and the company has introduced it with 1440 x 720 pixel resolution .
the phone has an outdoor mode , which does not make it difficult to see the screen even in the sunlight .
for the youngsters chatting on whatsapp in the dark of night , techno has also given an eye care mode in this phone which keeps the brightness of the phone soft and smooth in the dark .
like the previous smartphones of camon eye , this phone also supports inadvertent mode .
the advantage of this is that if the phone is placed in a pocket or somewhere , it prevents unwanted touch or click .
during use , the display of the camon i twin definitely has fingerprints but due to the brightness of the phone , it does not look special when the screen is on , that is , you can use the rest of the phone .
it can be said that despite full flower view display , it is difficult to use the entire screen with one hand .
however , for the convenience of users , it has a one-hand mode .
techno camon i twin android 8.0.0 has been introduced on the 3.2.0 version of oreo based hios .
there is nothing new in the phone &apos;s user interface .
like the previous smartphones launched by the company , you will also get to see the same look and theme .
every time you press the power button in the lock screen , a new wallpaper will appear .
apps like phone master and freezer have been provided in the phone , which also keeps the applications that are not used for a long time in sleep mode and saves the phone &apos;s ram .
camon eye twin has a lot of preloaded apps .
on one side , social networking apps like facebook , facebook messenger , whatsapp and instagram are preloaded in the phone .
on the other hand , applications like carlcare and phx browser are provided in the high group .
the phone also has apps like freezer , boost and clean which works to clear cache memory and delete junk files .
apart from this , data saving feature and whatsapp mode are also available which prevents the consumption of internet .
apart from this , new apps come even after os update ,
it can be said that with so many apps , there are problems .
many apps are without work , which only serves to fill memory .
you can uninstall some preloaded apps , but not all .
at the same time , during use , it keeps telling many recommended apps , which will also annoy you a bit .
overall , the software and ui will bother you a bit .
the techno camon i twin has been introduced on a 3 gb ram memory .
the phone has 32 gb of internal storage .
the phone has expandable memory support which can be increased through microsd card .
this phone runs on qualco mm &apos;s snapdragon 425 chipset and has a quad-core processor clocked at 1.4 ghz clock speed .
although you can call the processor a bit old and weak .
but we did not find any problem in performance .
during almost a week of use , this hang did not happen nor did we see any decrease in speed .
yes , games with heavy graphics will make a difference .
features such as bluetooth , wifi , gps as well as screen cost and hot spots are provided in the camon i twin .
the sim tray is inserted on the right panel of the phone , in which two sim cards and a microsd card slot have been given .
in addition to the simple pin and pattern lock , this phone will get a fingerprint sensor on the back panel .
apart from this , face unlock is also supported .
the placement of the rear fingerprint sensor is good and it unlocks the phone fast .
the face unlock feature works well there .
like its first smartphone , the company has also given the option of flash light with face unlock feature in this phone .
due to this , the option of light comes to light when the face is not clear in the dark of night .
light is turned on as soon as tapping on this option , and the phone also stops immediately after unlocking .
the techno camon i twin is offered by the company on a 4,000 mah powerful battery .
there is no quick charge support in the phone but still in 1 hour this phone charges up to 85 percent of the battery .
the standby capacity of the battery is very good as well as the usage of normal facebook , whatsapp and calling also removes this phone comfortably two days and one night .
on the other hand , when we did a video loop test on the phone , up to 80 percent of the battery was discharged in 10 hours .
techno &apos;s camon i twin is priced at rs 11,499 .
the first glimpse of the camon eye twin captivates you .
the phone has a usp , it has a camera segment which is not very special but is good .
battery backup is also good and will not disappoint users .
the display is also better and the processor and memory are fine .
in this budget , phones like xiaomi redmi note 5 , realme 1 and asus zenfone max pro m1 are far ahead .
in terms of specification , these phones are ahead of the camon i twin .
while the processors of xiaomi and asus are strong , real me one captures its style .
the moto e5 plus competes with this in a large battery segment .
the phone has a 5,000 mah battery .
however , on the basis of the dual camera , the camon outshines the moto .
finally , put it clearly , if you are shopping online , then you have some good phones available from it .
but when shopping from offline store , camon eye is a better option .
in this price range at offline stores , there are no phones with bezel less display with dual cameras .
earlier it was said that innovation is done only by companies like apple and samsung .
chinese mobile manufacturers only follow him .

after the arrival of the smartphone , it was believed that the tv market would end .
people will watch the content they like on the big screen mobile tv .
but the smart thinking and the best technology from the tv makers brought color and the tv market shone again .
televisions have become smarter and slim as well .
smart tv market in india , including the world , coffee is growing rapidly and everyday new company is knocking .
in such a situation , french company thomson has once again started its second innings in the indian market .
the company has introduced two 43-inch 4k tvs in the b9 range and one in the ud9 series .
the thomson ud9 series 108 cm ( 43-inch ) ultra hd 4k led smart tv was also available for us to review and we have discussed in detail the merits and demerits of this tv .
thomson ud 9 series 108 cm ( 43-inch ) ultra hd 4k led smart tv is very good when it comes to design .
despite the big screen , the tv will not look too big and can be easily hung or placed anywhere .
the company has reduced the side bezels considerably and it looks quite smart .
the length , width and thickness of the tv with the stand is 1085 mm x 635 mm x 145 mm while without the stand it becomes 1030 mm x 630 mm x 140 mm .
it is available in quite a neat and tidy design .
on the front side , only thomson &apos;s logo will appear in the bottom and a small led power light on the left side .
you will also like it in terms of weight , its weight is only 9.8 kg with box .
tv weighs even less .
you can hang it anywhere with ease .
overall , you will like the design a lot but in terms of quality , the company has compromised a little .
the body is plastic , so it will not make it feel premium .
yes , in terms of price , it is good .
moving away from the design , the company has introduced it with a 43-inch led display , whose screen resolution is 3840 x 2160 pixels , also known as ultra hd or 4k .
it supports 16.7 million display colors and the tv &apos;s viewing angle is 178 × 178 degrees .
it is clear that if you live in any corner , you can get a clear view .
the most important thing that can be said is that the company has used samsung display panel , then is known for its excellent view .
its aspect ratio is 16 : 9 which is seen in the new standard format of tv .
the contrast ratio is 30000000 : 1 and the response time is 8 milli-seconds .
the brightness level is 550 nits , which is better .
at the same time , it can be said that it is hdr 10 ready .
that is , while watching tv you will experience exactly as if the actual scene is going on in front of the eyes .
picture quality was found to be great during the review .
the performance of the graphics and colors was also very good .
it was also easily playing 4k videos including high definition fullhd videos .
however , while playing 4k videos , there was a slight reduction in the video quality that we were hoping for .
the smoothness of the video was low .
perhaps the reason for this can be said that the refresh rate of this tv is only 60 hz .
however the 60 hz standard and most tvs come with this frame rate .
yes , you will be very happy watching hd and full hd videos and there will be no problem of any kind .
sound the sound
of this 43-inch ultra hd 4k tv of thomson ud 9 series will also impress you .
the company has given two built-in speakers of 20 watts , which is at the bottom .
in addition , it supports surround sound .
settings such as automatic volume level , audio equalizer will be available in the tv , but they are not very useful . for audio it supports formats like wma , mp3 and m4a .
however , during the review , we found that a slim led tv had much more than the volume label .
the sound can be heard easily in a very large room .
on the outside , it will be effective without any additional speakers during the match or any function .
while surround sound also gives you better effect , you can experience it while listening to music .
os
thomson ud9 series 43-inch ultra hd 4k tv has been introduced on android tv os 4.4 which is based on the company &apos;s own tv ui 5.1.1 .
icon coffees appear larger on tv and are much clearer and can be easily navigated .
yes the interface is quite dense and you get a little annoyed while working from remote .
apps like youtube and netflix are already available on tv .
apart from this , other apps can also be downloaded from the play store .
although some apps have problems with downlifting and there are many app downloads but crashes .
the tv works on an arm based kotex a7 chipset and is a 1.4 ghz dualcore processor with 64 bits .
along with this , there is also 1 gb of ram memory and 8 gb of inbuilt storage .
for connectivity , it will also get 3 hdmi ports , 2 usb ports , 2 vga ports , 1 pc , 1 headphone , wifi and lan connectivity .

we connected it to many phones and it was working well .
it also has a voiceport .
thomson ud 9 series 108 cm ( 43-inch ) ultra hd 4k led smart tv is available for sale at the online store flipkart where it is priced at rs 27,999 .
this budget will be called a great deal .

recently the smartphone maker techno has introduced the best smartphone in a low budget .
the company has launched &apos; camon eye click &apos; in the indian market .
as the name itself suggests , this phone has been specially designed keeping in mind the photography segment .
techno has introduced this smartphone only for the users who like to use the camera more in the smartphone .
this phone with 20-mp selfie and 16-mp rear camera has been launched in the country at a price of rs 13,999 .
in this budget segment , along with xiaomi and honor , the new brand realme is also keeping a good hold .
in such a situation , we have to use techno camon iclick for a few days to see how much competition techno can compete with other brands and meet the expectations of the users .
since it has been introduced specifically for photography , let &apos;s start the review with the camera .
the 16-megapixel rear camera is provided on the back panel of the camon eye , which is equipped with quad led flash .
the camera setup is in the horizontal shape at the top right .
this camera has power of f / 1.8 aperture .
similarly , a 20-megapixel selfie camera with f / 2.0 aperture has been given on the front panel of the phone .
along with the selfie camera , where dual led flash is provided , the front camera also supports screen flash .
the quality of the rear camera of the phone is good .
it has beauty mode and super pixel mode .
the rear camera does not offer portrait mode or boca effect .
yes there is hdr mode and photography is quite good in it .
object &apos;s colors are captured perfectly with the rear camera , which makes the photo sharp and bright .
on the other hand , zooming a photo clicked from the rear camera in slightly less light shows a bit of noise when we were hoping for a bit better .
special work has been done on this techno phone for selfie .
the lack of portrait mode found in the rear camera is not in the front camera .
the company has equipped selfie camera with portrait mode and you can take photos with blur background .
however the portrait feature in the selfie camera does not work on beauty mode .
while taking selfies , the object &apos;s edge did not feel sharp , a little more work is needed .
the phone &apos;s beauty mode is better .
while led flash is provided with the front camera , it also works with screen flash .
due to both options , selfie can be taken without burn even in low light .
camera filters are also breathtaking .
selfie clicked by camon i click will be liked by young users .
techno has introduced this phone on its polycarbonate body .
screen to body ratio of 83.9 percent has been given .
antenna band design has been given on the top and bottom on the back panel of the phone .
the phone is quite slim and light in weight .
the display on the phone is quite big but still not uncomfortable to hold .
the front panel of the phone is completely button laced .
on the front panel , there is a speaker in the middle towards the top and flash light on the right side of the speaker and selfie camera and sensor is on the left side .
the rear camera setup is given in the upper left on the back panel of camon eye click .
the back panel is the only fingerprint sensor whose placement has been done quite well .
the sim slot , volume rocker and power key are given on the left panel of the phone .
similarly , the speaker grill , usb port and 3.5 mm jack have been given on the bottom panel .
the surface of the phone is quite shy and makes a good grip while using it .
we have the sheppen gold variant of the phone which is attractive to look at .
while techno camon eye click has the ability to entice you in the first look itself , it will feel very light and comfortable even when taking this phone in hand .
the techno camon iclick has a 6-inch fullview display that supports hd plus ( 1440 x 720 ) resolution .
the display of the phone is large , which makes the experience of viewing photos and videos good .
to make the phone easy to use , the company has equipped the phone with features like outdoor mode and eye care mode .
outdoor mode where the phone &apos;s display is bright even in sunlight and makes it easy to watch videos as well as read text .
at the same time , the eye care mode keeps the phone &apos;s usage comfortable for users chatting on facebook or whatsapp in the dark of night .
camon iclick inadvertent mode has been given , which prevents it from being unnecessarily touched when the phone is kept in the pocket .
the color of the phone is quite sharp .
even in high resolution video , this phone beautifully captures all the colors and provides a great experience to the users .
although the company has not given information about screen protection but during the use , we did not face the problem like fingerprints on the display .
overall , the display of techno camon i click makes use great .
techno camon eye click android 8.1.0 has been introduced on oreo based hios .
the operating system of the phone is quite excellent .
it is as easy to use as it is also attractive .
the wallpaper keeps changing automatically when the phone is locked and at the same time every time the screen light is on , some motive message also flashes on the screen .
we have also seen this kind of feature in opo &apos;s high end device f7 .
social networking apps like facebook , facebook messenger , whatsapp and instagram are preloaded in the phone .
apps like &apos; phone master &apos; and &apos; freezer &apos; are also present in the phone , while taking care of ram processing , it also takes the applications which are not used for a long time into sleep mode .
the &apos; multi window &apos; feature has been provided in the phone to do two different tasks simultaneously in camon eye click .
there is also a &apos; one-hand mode &apos; in the phone to make it easier to use on the big screen .
in addition to the &apos; data saving &apos; feature , this phone has a &apos; whatsapp &apos; mode , which when turned on , all apps stop using internet data and only whatsapp is able to use the data .
similarly , to see notifications without opening the lock , &apos; lockscreen notification &apos; mode has also been provided in the phone .

the phone has 64 gb of internal storage , which can be increased through microsd card .
this phone runs on mediatek &apos;s helio p23 chipset with a 64 bit octa-core processor clocked at 2.0 ghz .
we liked this phone in terms of processing .
problems such as warming up while playing some games and watching videos on the internet were also not found in camon eye click .
techno camon eye click is a dual sim phone that supports 4g volte .
the phone has basic features like bluetooth , wifi , hotspot as well as otg support and cast features .
for security , where the fingerprint sensor has been given on the back panel of the phone , this phone is also equipped with face unlock technology .
the fingerprint sensor on the back panel makes it easy to reach the user &apos;s fingers despite the large display .
face unlock given in the phone is also very fast .
the lock screen can be opened very fast thanks to this feature .
techno has also taken care of the fact that the face unlock feature does not prove to be useless if the face is not visible in the dark of night .
when the face appears blurred in the dark , this phone automatically brings the option of light on which the front flash burns on tap and the phone automatically turns off as soon as it is unlocked .
camon iclick has been launched by techno with 3,750 mah battery .
due to the large battery power of the phone , this phone has the ability to provide excellent backup .

to keep track of battery consumption , &apos; power management &apos; feature has also been provided in the phone , which provides information about the battery used by the background running service along with power optimization .
the phone also has standby intelligent power saving feature along with battery saver mode .
the power optimization mode only reboots the battery consumption in the backgroun once tapped , and saves battery consumption from the app as well as processes such as brightness and data sync .
techno camon eye click has been launched in the country at a price of rs 13,999 by the company .
the phone has a good look and the display is also better .
battery backup also keeps users satisfied .
however , this phone camera has been taken special care of and picture quality is also good .
but we were hoping for better .
despite the high megapixels , the camera performance remained poor .
the features of the phone are good and its performance is also good .
overall , the phone is good .
yes , it will definitely say that in this budget there are some phones like xiaomi redmi note 5 , asus zenfone max pro m1 and realme 1 which can challenge it in specification , but all these phones are available at the online store while techno camon iclick is available to you offline . you can buy it from the store and here it proves to be a good phone .
by the way , new phones are launched everyday in the indian market .
most companies bring more than 10 phones a year .
but there are some who remain in the headlines throughout the year only by launching one or two models .
the first name of these comes from apple .
at the same time , oneplus has the same feature in android phones .
the company launches only one or two models in a year , but is built over the years on the tongue of the mobile user .
recently , the company has introduced oneplus 6 in india but it would be surprising to know that the discussion about this phone was going on for the last 6 months .
at the same time , the noise has not reduced even after the launch .
sandisk 400 gb microsd card review : the phone will have a 400 gb hard disk
although there were many reasons behind the noise .
one is the first phone to be launched in india using a qualco mm snapdragon 845 chipset .
on the other hand , its os which is near to stock .
in such a situation , it is being considered as one of the fastest phones .
the third feature is the notch screen .
like the iphone 10 , the company has introduced it with the nokia display .
now the question is , does this live up to the things that are being discussed about the phone or are they just specifications ? this time the challenge for oneplus 6 is even greater .
because the oneplus 5 and 5t launched last year were very popular and the new phone is a challenge to retain this popularity .
with the launch , this phone has also become available for review and we have used it for over two weeks .
after use , we can say that this is actually the best phone .
oneplus 6 is not only more stylish than before but has also become quite powerful .
yes , this time you can definitely complain about the price .
in the last one year , the price of oneplus phone has increased by about rs 5,000 .
despite this , it makes full recovery of money .
however , where we found some deficiency , we have also mentioned further .
and during the review , the phone is followed in detail so that you can take a right decision .
so let &apos;s start the review with the design and talk in detail about the strengths and shortcomings of the flagship keeler oneplus 6 .
glossy design
oneplus 6 was introduced with a glossy glass back panel and is the second model from the company to use this material .
earlier in the year 2015 , a small model oneplus x was launched which had a glass back .
while oneplus introduced its first ( 1 ) and 2 phones in sand stone design , 3 , 3t , 5 and 5t in metal design .
now the company is back on glass again .
as far as build quality is concerned , it is superb and will make you feel premium .
this time there were many changes in the design .
one , the silent button has been shifted from right to left .
on the other hand , the camera in the oneplus 5t was in the top corner .
this time , it has been shifted in the middle .
along with this , last time where dual camera was given in horizontal style .
this time it is in vertical style .
the fingerprint scanner which was in round shape in the phone of oneplus till now has been given in the oval shape .
at the same time , you will get a bezel less with the notch screen .
because of this , the phone looks more attractive .
although the phone has become 0.5  mm thick compared to the old model , but you will not realize this much .
there is also a difference in length and width with the thickness of the phone .
the phone comes comfortably in the palm but you will not be able to use the entire phone with one hand .
at the same time , due to the glossy design , it slips a little .
you have to be careful here .
it is better if you put a case .
overall , the design is excellent but due to the slippery glass body you need to use it carefully .
after oneplus &apos;s first nokia
iphone 10 , people had already realized the nokia screen in phones like vivo v9 and oppo f7 .
in such a situation it was not new .
yes the feeling was definitely fun .
on the notch screen , other things including notifications , battery , network and wifi come , so you can use the full screen below .
if you want , you can use the bezel-less display only by removing the notch .
there is an option in the setting .
the company has introduced it in full hd + ( 1080 x 2280 pixels ) resolution , while the optic panel has been used for better display .
the display of the phone is excellent and the touch response is also excellent .
although you can say that some of the previous models also had full hd display .
in such a situation , they were expecting quad hd this time .
but this did not happen .
however , we have no complaints with the display .
hard hardware
as we all know , oneplus has always been known for the top notch specification and this phone also will not disappoint you .
oneplus 6 has been introduced on the qualco mm snapdragon 845 chipset , which is currently considered to be the most powerful chipset .
this is the first phone to be launched in india with this chipset .
on the phone , you will find a 2.8 ghz octa-core ( 4 × 2.8 ghz koryo 385 gold + 4 × 1.7 ghz koryo 385 silver ) processor .
along with this , there is an adreno 630 gpu which is capable of running heavy to heavy graphics .
this phone is available with 6 gb ram / 64 gb memory , 8 gb ram / 128 gb memory .
we had a variant with 8 gb ram memory and it can be said from the claim that it is one of the fastest phones at the moment .
it ran a heavy graphics game that was absolutely smooth .
not a little leg was found .
it doesn &apos;t matter how many tabs you open at the same time .
for security , the company has equipped it with features like face unlock with fingerprint scanner .
its face unlock is also very fast .
unlock easily in low light .
it never failed during the experiment .
the near two stock
company has kept it near to stock .
in such a situation , it will make you feel like pure android .
smooth operating with powerful hard ware further enhances the usefulness of this phone .
you will not see other apps in the phone other than the google app .
yes , oneplus switch app will be available so that you can easily shift from the old oneplus to the new oneplus .
it gets almost all the data including the content and the message .
options such as gaming mode and reading mode are provided in the phone .
it blocks notifications during gaming mode .
at the same time , the screen becomes monochrome in reading mode .
in such a situation , the pressure on the eyes reduces while reading something on the screen at night .
since it works on android oreo , you can use multi-window as well .
for this , by going to the task manager , you have to touch the app and hold it for some time .
camera plus
there is no doubt that the phone has been upgraded a lot in terms of specification .
at the same time , we also found the camera much better than before .
the phone has a 16-megapixel lens with f / 1.7 aperture .
it has features like electronic image stabilization and optical image stabilization .
the second sensor is 20-megapixel , which has been introduced with f / 1.7 aperture .
options such as face detection and hdr will be available with the camera .
for photography , the phone has the option of portrait mode , slow motion and pro mode .
the matter of picture quality is very good .
we can not call it the best camera phone but it has become much better than oneplus 5t .
performs good photography in good light , but its result is amazing even in low light .
you can take a picture with a blur background .
the photo detailing is good and it does not burst even when zooming .
despite the single camera , it has the option of portrait mode .
the phone &apos;s selfie camera is good but was hoping for better .
the front camera can record videos at a rate of 60 frames per second at fullhd resolution .
the main camera supports 4k video record .
data + network
network connectivity is good and there was no problem in connecting wifi too .
both the slots of the phone are nano and both can use 4g .
at the same time , usb type c has been given in the phone , which is for fast data transfer and fast charging .
this phone is fully charged in about an hour .
which can be said very well .
oneplus 6 has been introduced in three versions in the indian market .
the model with 64 gb memory with 6 gb ram is priced at rs 34,999 .
the other model is 128 gb memory with 8 gb ram and its price is rs 39,999 .
at the same time , the company introduced an avengers model which has a memory of 256 gb with 8 gb ram .
however it was a limited edition and will no longer go on sale .
although we had reviewed several microsd cards earlier , but perhaps not so much enthusiasm .
because this time it was something like this .
we were reviewing the world &apos;s highest storage microsd card .
yes , you heard exactly right that microsd card is offered for phones much more than memory is often not in people &apos;s pc .
a few months ago , sandisk launched the sandisk ultra microsdxc uhs-1 , 400 gb microsd card , and incidentally this card was available to us for review as well and we were able to test it without delay .
although many people may be wondering that in which phone the 400 gb card will be supported so that it can be tested , then let me tell you that we had samsung galaxy s9 plus available to review this card of this sandisk which has up to 4 tb expandable memory support .
with the arrival of the card , we inserted it into the phone without delay and the result is in front of you .
it is important to mention here that this is a ultra series card of sandisk , so its data transfer speed is slightly less than the extreme series .
the company has claimed 100 mb per second data transfer , while in the actrim series this speed is 160 mb per second .
the 100mb speed card is read speed but nowhere is the right speed mentioned .
the company has not mentioned about disk write speed anywhere .
during the review of this card of sandisk ultra microsdxc 400 gb , we also did many tests and found a big difference in the speed test .
during the test , we used the blackmagic disk speed ​ ​ test on apple &apos;s mac pc where it was able to get a read speed of 90 mb per second .
while the right speed was 58 mb per second .
emoi mushroom review : the dj will play 360 degree sound and the party will be colorful on the floor ,
while on the windows pc we used the crystal discmark software and here it was able to get a maximum read speed of 27 mb and almost the same right speed .
apart from this , we also checked the speed by transferring data by ourselves and the result there was very impressive .
connecting to the apple macbook , we transferred 5 gb of data from the pc to the card , which was completed in just 2 minutes .
at the same time , we inserted the card in our samsung galaxy s9 plus and transferred about one gb of data from the card to the phone , which was transferred in about 10 seconds .
it was a music file that is easily transferred .
at the same time , about 5 gb data card was transferred from the phone .
it contained photo and video files .
this data transfer was completed in about 2 minutes .
overall , the data transfer speed of sandisk ultra microsdxc 400 gb is good and you will not take much time in heavy data transfer .
yes , according to the condition of the pc and the phone , a slight difference in data transfer rate can be seen .
finally it comes to whether it should be taken .
so let me tell you that the way phone usage has increased today and people use more data on the phone .
in such a situation , this 400 gb microsd card of sandiska is very useful for you .
however , it is also true that only a few phones have support .
in such a situation , not everyone can buy it .
this is only for some premium users .
this is the reason why the company is charging a premium cost for this card .
sandisk ultra microsdxc uhs-1 , 400 gb mrp of this card is rs 23,990 .
although it will be available in the market at a slightly lower price , but still it can be said to be a bit expensive .
alcatel pop 4 has launched 10-inch 4g tablet .
the tablet also supports 4g network connectivity as well as wi-fi support .
the price of this phone in the indian market is rs 10,999 .
we have also received this tablet for review .
in order to know how much this tablet will attract users in the low budget segment , we tested it in every way and the result is in front of you .
the big screen tablet has very large bezels .
in such a situation , if you connect it with the keyboard , the mini laptop will be visible .
as far as looks are concerned , we cannot say good looks very attractive .
the larger it is in size , the lighter it feels in weight .
however , the large bezel also has its advantage .
can be easily used by holding in hand .
due to bezels , there will also be facility to watch videos and play games .
the sim card slot and microsd card slot are given on the back panel .
rear camera is present on the left side on the back panel .
there is no flash light with the rear camera .
it would have been better if there were flash lights .
speakers are provided in both sites on the front panel of the tablet .
the selfie camera is on the top right of the front panel .
the right panel of the tablet has a usb slot and 3.5 mm audio jack , while the upper panel has a power button and volume rocker .
the display has a downward navigation function , which works for coming to the home page , going back step and closing the running app .
similarly , when you slide down from anywhere on the top of the tab , the notification bar is open , that is , there is no need to click on a fixed part for the notification bar or shortcut settings .
the alcatel pop 4 is equipped with a 10.1-inch fullhd display with 1920 x 1200 pixel resolution .
there is no doubt that the display is great and having full hd in this budget would be a very good thing .
touch is very smooth .
good thing we found that it was very easy to do &apos; one handed use &apos; .
it can be scrolled only by touching on a display site .
yes , but to open an app , you have to use second hand .
icons and text on the tablet &apos;s large display are also large and bright , which is helpful to read any content .
picture quality was also good while watching the video .
color , brightness and sharpness are better .
alcatel pop 4 has a &apos; waves max audio &apos; app which claims to give better quality sound while watching movies or listening to songs .
during the use , we used it in both auto and manual modes , the sound was fine and to some extent the surround effect was also available .
this device is based on android marshmallow and this will be called a shortcoming .
because it has been a long time coming .
the tablet is offered on a qualco mm 430 chipset and has a 1.4 ghz octa-core processor .
also , adreno 505 gpu has also been given for graphics .
from the company , this tablet has 16 gb of internal storage with 2 gb of ram , which can be increased to 32 gb via microsd card .
the tablet &apos;s processing was decent during gaming , but the frames were slightly lagging .
wishing a bit better in the hardware and software segment overall .
while an 8-megapixel rear camera is provided on the back panel of the alcatel pop 4 tablet , there is a 5-megapixel camera on its front panel .
no more modes or filters are provided in the camera .
camera and quality are also average .
however , from a tablet &apos;s point of view .
the company has introduced it with a 5,830 mah battery .
despite the large screen , battery backup is good and even after handling persistent , browsing messaging and minor tasks , it easily lasts the entire day .
yes , if you have connected to the bluetooth keyboard then the battery backup is greatly reduced .
keyboards
along with alcatel pop 4 , the company has provided keyboards .
the buttons on this keyboard are not too narrow , so typing will not be a problem .
it can be connected to the tablet via bluetooth and connectivity is quite good .
at the same time , it also works very fast .
the keyboard has a slot where you can place the tablet and it will make the laptop feel perfect .
the tablet also closes nicely with the keyboard .
it is very easy to keep .
it is capable of performing many important functions of the keyboard function only in a shortcut manner .
however , the battery consumption of the tablet increases slightly due to the keyboard .
sales pack
the box has a tablet , keyboard , charger , usb cable and warranty card .
also , to protect the display of the tablet , it also has a hard lamination sheet , which the user can apply on the screen by itself .
talking about the price , alcatel has launched the pop 4 10 in the indian market at a price of rs 10,999 , which can be purchased from the shopping site flipkart .
if you want to get a keyboard with this tablet , then you have to pay an additional rs 3,999 .
after looking at the price features and specifications , you can say that the functionality of the tablet is very good and you will also like it .
there is also a good deal according to the price , but less ram and memory can become a problem for it .
tech company techno has made a good hold in the indian market in a short time .
fan followings of techno are growing rapidly among companies like xiaomi , micromax and lava , considered strong in the low budget segment .
techno , the company offering smartphones equipped with the best specifications at a low price , has launched its new smartphone camon i sky in the indian market .
the price of this phone in the market has been kept at rs 7,499 and it is available for sale at online shopping sites as well as offline retail stores .
we have also received this phone for review , but before detailed investigation of the features and specifications , we have brought for you the first glimpse of the techno camon i sky .
this phone of low range is quite good to watch .
in the front panel of the phone , you will see a bezel-less display .
the back panel is made of polycarbonate .
however , it feels much better in metal finish .
the corners of the phone are curved .
because of this it feels very comfortable to hold .
the techno camon i sky features a 5.45-inch large bezel-less display with a screen-to-body ratio of 81.3 percent .

yes , if you want to listen to the song while holding the phone in your hand , then the speaker will hide in your palm and the sound of the song will be buried .
techno camon i sky has a fullview fw + ips display with a resolution of 960 × 480 pixels , which the company has protected from the layer .
eye care feature is also available for eye protection .
the display of the phone is also very bright and the touch response is smooth even when the phone is fast typeed on the default keyboard .
this phone is offered on highos based android 8.1.0 oreo and runs on mediatek mtk 6739 chipset with a 1.28 ghz quad-core processor .
the phone has 16 gb of internal storage with 2 gb of ram memory .
the expandable store of the phone is not known yet .
at the same time , we will tell the processing of the phone in our review after some time of use .
techno camon i sky has a 13-megapixel rear camera and an 8-megapixel selfie camera .
both camera setups support beauty mode as well as color filters .
the selfie camera is equipped with portrait mode .
the results of both cameras have been average when the photo was taken .
the portrait effect of the selfie camera was blurring the main object along with the background .

even though opo and vivo make android phones , these brands always like to compare themselves to apple .
whatever trend apple brings , opo and vivo are the first to follow .
even though you cannot say it bad .
apple phones are in very expensive budgets .
at the same time , these companies offer it in a low budget .
recently , opo has introduced the f7 model in india .
this phone has been introduced with the nokia display like the iphone 10 launched last year .
where apple &apos;s starting price is rs 89,000 .
at the same time , opo f7 has been launched at an initial price of rs 21,990 .
however , it is not that oppo has forgotten the selfie in the context of the nokia screen , but this phone is also available with a great selfie camera .
although here we will not compare f7 with apple right now but we will definitely try to know if the purchase of opo f7 makes sense .
because even though we are not paying rs 1 lakh , the budget of rs 21,990 also does not decrease .
some days during the use of this phone , we tried to know the specifics of the phone and the result is in front of you .
looking at the phone from the front , you can say that in terms of look , it is different from all the phones launched by opo so far .
although this phone is available in solar red , moonlight silver , diamond black colors , but we received the solar red color variant and can say that it is very attractive .
you will see only the screen on the main panel of the phone .
it has been introduced at a screen-to-body ratio of 89.09 percent .
the front panel of the phone has a bezel-less display with the notch .
while the sides and the upper edges of the phone are completely bezel-less , the bottom has very minor bezels .
selfie camera and earpiece are present in the upper notch .
on the right side , led flash and single camera is provided on the back panel , while the fingerprint sensor will be available just below the camera .
the rear camera of the opo f7 is slightly raised above the phone surface and is circular .
3.5 mm jack , usb port and speaker are given at the bottom of the phone .
due to the shiny back panel , there has been a problem of small fingerprints during the use but not much so that it looks dirty .
the slim design and great color variant gives it a good look .
it easily fits into the palm despite the large screen .
yes kami , you can just say that its body is made of polycarbonate .
it would have been better if it had been metal or ceramic .
the opo f7 is the company &apos;s first nokia screen phone launched in india , which has been introduced on a display with 19 : 9 aspect ratios .
this phone has a 6.23-inch large bezel-less display with a notch on the upper part .
the phone comes with full hd + 2280 x 1080 pixels resolution .
the display of the phone is quite bright in which all the colors come in full bloom .
it has an auto brightness mode and adjusts from all types of lighting conditions to provide clear visibility .
during gaming and video , the oppo f7 also got a good combination .
oppo has protected this phone with corning gorilla glass 5 which protects the screen from scratches and scratches .
at the same time , fingerprints were also found on the phone screen during use , which makes it a bit annoying while watching the video .
if the oppo f7 works on color os 5.0 , then the android operating system is based on 8.1 oreo .
the operating system of the phone is user friendly .
the wallpaper on the lock screen not only changes automatically , but when you click on those wallpapers , the phone also gives you information related to those wallpapers .
we have also seen such options in amigo ui in gionee phones .
if you leave one or two social networking and ecommerce apps in the phone , then no other preloaded applications have been provided .
the phone manager in the opo f7 optimizes the phone by cleaning up storage , cache memory and junk files in one click .
the &apos; tips &apos; present in the phone tells the user the advantages and requirements of each app .
the ofo f7 provides a very simple and fast experience to use .
the phone has a split screen feature that allows two different applications to be used simultaneously .
although the notch screen is a new feature , despite this , the view has also been given the option to control it according to your convenience .
for example , on the &apos; full screen multitasking &apos; feature , app shortcut icons come in the notch area and sliding them like a screen opens the app .
similarly , in &apos; notch area display control &apos; , the option to open the app to the notch screen and stay below the notch screen can be selected .
at the same time , the option of &apos; assisted ball &apos; is also present in the phone to make the use of big screen easier .
you can place it anywhere on the screen .
two models of opo f7 have been launched in india .
one has 64 gb memory with 4 gb ram and the other has 128 gb storage with 6 gb ram .
both variants have memory card support up to 256 gb .
this phone runs on the mediatek helio p60 chipset and has a 64-bit octa-core processor .
at the same time , arm mali-g72 has been given for graphics .
we had the 4 gb variant of the oppo f7 available for review , which was superb processing .
in spite of playing 45 minutes of games like asphalt 8 , the phone did not have a hitting problem .
problems of lag or hang were not found anywhere during gaming .
in the same way , the phone is neither heated nor has the lag seen in touch and response under long video recording or charging .
overall the performance of the opo f7 is superb .
like all previous phones of opo , the camera segment of opo f7 is a very special one .
this phone has a 25-megapixel selfie camera equipped with the power of ai technology i.e. artificial intelligence .
a 16-megapixel rear camera with f / 1.8 aperture equipped with led flash is present on the back panel of the phone .
first of all talk about selfie camera , f7 has also enhanced the self-centric brand image of opo .
the phone &apos;s selfie camera is excellent .
while beauty modes and filters present in the phone enhance the beauty of the selfie , the ar stickers in the phone make the selfie session fun with friends .
the artificial intelligence support of opo f7 itself makes the selfie attractive by sensing lights , weather etc .
the rear camera present in the opo f7 is also equipped with beauty mode and filters .
along with led light support , it also has ar stickers and expert mode .
this camera supports zoom up to 4x .
we did not see the problem of pixelation in photos taken from the rear camera .
however , to capture a distant object when the photo is clicked by zooming , the result was slightly worse , here the pixels of the photo were bursting and the quality was deteriorating .
talking about some of the special factors of photography , &apos; deep effect &apos; and &apos; super vivid &apos; modes have been given on both the rear and front cameras .
both these modes are very special .
while the depth effect works to defocus or blur the background behind the object , the super vivid mode is used for color correction .
during our use , we have found the super vivid mode to be very useful .
this mode brings out all the colors in your frame and makes the photo beautiful and attractive .
at the same time , the result of the depth effect mode was not very special .
the camera of the f7 has failed to understand the object and background shape and is also blurring the edges of the object in the defocus effect .
security and connectivity while
oppo f7 &apos;s back panel has been given fingerprint sensor , this phone also supports face unlock feature .
the phone &apos;s face unlock feature is quite fast .
at night , even when the phone &apos;s display light falls , it is unlocked by recognizing the face of the user .
yes , if you have goggles , then in such a situation it will clearly refuse to recognize you .
the phone has dual nano sim which supports 4g volte band .
the oppo f7 has bluetooth , wifi and gps .
at the same time , otg support has been provided to connect usb .
power system
oppo f7 has a battery of 3,400 mh for power backup .
to save battery consumption , a power saving mode has also been provided in the phone , which saves energy by turning off background data .
the opo f7 does not support any fast charging technology , but in spite of this the battery charging has been quite fast .
the battery or phone body did not heat up during charging .
when you use normal after full charge , not only can you get a full day &apos;s rest with the opo f7 , but it also has the ability to play songs for you to relax and sleep at night .
when the battery percentage is less than 15 , it takes 3 hours in power saving mode .
the 4 gb ram and 64 gb storage variants of the opo f7 have been launched by the company at a price of rs 21,990 .
this variant has become available for sale in the market from 9 april .
it can also be purchased from online retail stores as well as online platforms .
along with this , the company has also launched the oppo f7 diamond black special variant with 6 gb ram and 128 gb storage , which has been priced at rs 26,990 .
this special variant will be available for sale in the coming days .
oppo f7 is one of the few smartphones in india in terms of design .
due to being selective , the competition of the phone is also strong .
overall , the oppo f7 is a good phone according to its budget , but in this budget , the company gets tough competition from vivo v9 .
both phones are available with the nokia screen but the vivo v9 has been introduced on a qualco mm chipset , which is considered to be much better .
the notch display and big screen of opo f7 have proved successful in wooing people .
the smooth and fast processing of the phone makes the user experience good and battery backup is also good .
although the rear camera of the phone is as good as a selfie camera , but the lack of dual functionality can be considered a drawback of the phone .
buying an oppo f7 for rs 21,990 is not a bad deal , but if you have a rival like vivo v9 with dual rear camera and you are not a fan of any particular brand , then the smartphone users may be inclined towards vivo .
as it is known , samsung launches its flagship phone in galaxy s and note series every year .
s series phones come in march while note phones knock till october .
this time also samsung galaxy s9 and galaxy s9 plus have become available in india in march .
equipped with the best design and display , these phones have been highly appreciated by the people and the users are also very keen to know about these phones as the innovation starts from here .
samsung starts and other brands follow it .
last year too , the company started with a bezelless display phone from s8 and later it became trend .
this time there is something more new .
till now it was seen that there was a screen difference between the galaxy s series and its plus model , but this time there are changes in the features with the display .
in such a situation , users have many questions about this phone .
like - how are these phones , what is new this time , is it right to take it , how is the performance and is the battery backup right ? incidentally , samsung galaxy s9 plus was also available for review from us and we have tried to answer these questions in our review .
know 8 great features of nokia 8 sirocco , why is this phone
premium look special ?
there is no doubt that samsung galaxy s9 and s9 plus will give you a glimpse of the galaxy s8 in terms of design but this much can be said that these phones are already have become more stylish .
the bezel in the phone is less than before and a slight difference can also be seen in the body screen ratio .
old phone , the screen ratio was 84 percent while in the new phone it has gone up to 84.2 percent .
along with this , the length of the phone is about 1  mm less .
although the thickness has increased slightly , but due to the excellent curved design and superb built quality , it makes for a very luxurious feel .
xiaomi redmi 4 vs redmi 5 , find out which phone is the stylish and powerful
phone body is built on aluminum frame and you will see the use of premium glass in both front and back .
samsung &apos;s expensive phones are mainly in this material .
silicon cover has been provided with the sales pack and believe that even if you keep the phone in hand by putting the cover , you will not be uncomfortable at all .
you will also find differences in design in the back panel .
in the rear panel , the heartrate sensor and fingerprint scanner have been given .
this time the placement of the fingerprint sensor has changed .
the rear panel of the phone has a fingerprint scanner , this time below the camera , while the s8 was side by side .
due to this there was difficulty in moving the finger there but now it has become much easier than before but still there is not very good placement .
fingerprint scanner would have been a little bigger and better .
after applying the cover there is a little trouble initially .
despite this , its design is amazing .
samsung galaxy s9 and s9 plus are ip68 certified .
that is , it is neutral from dust and water .
it can stay up to 30 minutes in 1 meter of water .
another change in design will be found .
after getting the phone in hand , we first tested it and it lived up to it .
we put it in water and kept it for at least 20 minutes and it was working properly .
super display
the samsung galaxy s9 plus will get a 6.2-inch super amoled quad hd + screen .
its screen resolution is 2960 x 1440 pixels .
generally , where the bezel-less display is of 18 : 9 aspect ratio , in this samsung phone this aspect ratio is 18.5 .
in this you get even less bezels .
the screen of the galaxy s9 plus has been given corning gorilla glass 5 protection , which is considered to be the best protection .
along with the bezelless display in the phone , you will get to see a dual curved screen .
the display is excellent and can be seen easily in the sun .
if you feel that the battery backup of the phone is getting weak then you can reduce the display resolution .
we had made it to hd resolution but believe it was so great that some of the phones kept with it were showing better than full hd .
despite a good coating , you will have to maintain it .
there is always a risk of scratch in the phone .
watching videos and playing games on the big screen will be more fun .
at the same time it can be said that it has hdr support and you can enjoy full hdr video .
in terms of display , it can be said that it is currently at the forefront .
great performance
this phone with premium design is also able to make you feel great performance .
the samsung galaxy s9 plus was initially introduced with 64 gb and 256 gb of internal storage , but later its 128 gb model was also launched .
we have a 64 gb model available .
the phone has memory card support and you can use cards up to 400 gb .
the galaxy s9 has 4 gb ram memory while the s9 plus is available with 6 gb .
like the galaxy s8 , the samsung galaxy s9 plus has also been introduced in two chipset models .
the company has launched it exnos 9810 chipset and qualco mm snapdragon 845 chipset .
exnos is a chipset phone in india .
it has two quad-core processors of the 4 × 2.8 ghz möngüz m3 and 4 × 1.9 ghz cortex-a55 .
as far as processing is concerned , you have no problem anywhere .
if you play a game with high graphics in it , the fun of the game will be doubled by watching the graphics .
it was also successful in scoring the highest on other benchmarks including the aintutu benchmark .
the use of bixby was not understood .
google assistant works very well in the phone .
at the same time , bixby does a bit of lag and is also slow .
due to this , the fun of the phone is a bit gritty .
easy to use
the galaxy s9 plus has been introduced on the samsung experience version 9.0 , which is based on the android operating system 8.0 oreo .
the company has given many new apps with the phone .
if you omit the edge screen features , then in operating it realizes the stock android .
its gesture features are also quite good .
on the home screen , you can open the menu by swiping from top to bottom or top to bottom .
at the same time , you can change the camera option with a swipe during the camera .
similarly , if you swipe the fingerprint scar , the notification bar will come down .
as it is known that there is no hardware button under the screen , in this case you have to depend on the screen button itself .
there are three android buttons at the bottom of the screen and you can either lock it on the screen or keep it swipeable to use the whole screen .
if you swipe from the bottom of the screen , it will come and it will go as soon as the app is open .
like other phones of samsung , you will find microsoft applications in galaxy s9 .
the phone has been given microsoft word , excel and power point .
these apps are able to make you feel desktop .
apart from google apps , apps like samsung app store , samsung health and members are also given .
the rear panel of the phone has a hardrate sensor .
although it cannot say how accurate it is , but it senses very fast .
it has multi windows support and can run two apps side by side simultaneously .
you will also see a very good change in the task manager .
you can see the apps in the list view and thumbnail view .
in thambanil view , content will appear inside an app , but in the list view , it comes as a notification .
however , its advantage is that you will be able to see almost all open tasks on the screen simultaneously .
the phone is quite easy to use .
the main difference between the samsung galaxy s9 and galaxy s9 plus is the camera itself .
while you will get to see a single camera in the s9 , the galaxy s9 plus has a 12-megapixel dual rear camera .
it has a sensor wide angle while the other telephoto has been given .
the company has introduced it with variable aperture .
can use f / 1.6 and f / 2.4 aperture with the same camera .
it is the first camera phone in the world to use technology in this way .
as is known , the camera takes pictures with the help of lights .
in this case , the variable overhead of the phone will prove to be quite useful .
the advantage of this is that the aperture itself will come to f / 1.6 in low light and so that the camera sensor can capture more .
at the same time , in high light conditions , it will be set to f / 2.4 and capture less light .
the advantage will be that the phone will take a good picture in the condition by doing this .
along with this , the company has also equipped features like dual pixels and ois .
the phone has options such as low light and bokeh effects .
apart from this , there will also be an option of ultra slow motion video in the phone , which is very good .
overall , it can be said that it is one of the best camera phones .
for selfie , the galaxy s9 plus has an 8-megapixel front camera with f / 1.7 aperture .
during the launch , the company claims that it is also capable of great photography and we also got it .
you cannot expect a better photo with an 8 megapixel camera .
most notably , we took a photo in the dark and it was able to take a clear picture .
the phone does not have a front flash but is screen light and is quite effective .
bixby vision integrated with the camera in the phone , which acts as the camera assistant and occupational reality for you .
when the camera is focused , it is able to give many special information based on your location .
at the same time , like the apple iphone , you can also make animosie according to any face , which is very good .
it creates animated emojis based on one &apos;s face .
you can also share this animos .
super fast data
samsung galaxy s9 plus has almost all the modern features available for connectivity .
this phone has dual sim support and can use 4g volte .
it has a cat 18 standard serpent for 4g .
that is , this phone is capable of downloading at speeds up to 1200 mbps and uploading at speeds up to 200 mbps .
apart from 4g , the phone will get wifi , bluetooth and nfc .
at the same time , it also has samsung pay .

you can ask for movie tickets , train tickets and ration at home .
but it is important that your phone has internet .

total feature runs in smartphones with operating systems and works on ussd based technology .

to check and test &apos; total &apos; , we received intex aqua lions n1 smartphone with airtel number .
on first arrival of a smartphone equipped with hike total , it is open like a normal smartphone and new users are welcomed with total logo , &apos; star &apos; , moving beyond the steps like gmail , time and protection .
here you are told that out of the pre-loaded apps in the total phone , those apps will be connected to the internet without data , on which star sign has been given .
applications equipped with star sign include messaging , hike wallet , recharge , cricket , news , horoscope and rail info .
google introduces new version of android &apos; p &apos; , learn how to install in your phone
after the phone is setup , the airtel number will have to be signed in to the phone &apos;s os supported total , for which the mobile number being used in the phone will have to be submitted .

on opening the hike wallet , one has to complete the kyc in which the aadhar card number and other information will have to be given .

talking about wallet first , you will get the option of booking recharge and bus tickets .
with this , a request to send and receive money can also be requested .
send money and request money can only be used among friends using hike .
keep in mind that hike &apos;s total service is currently launched only in india , in such a situation , this app will refuse to transact money on international numbers .
the monthly limit of total wallet has been kept up to rs 10,000 .
it has options like recharge , postpaid and money split .

talk about the other services of total , when we wanted to know the horoscope ( horoscope ) to know the single love life even after the elimination of the birth date . several aspects were reported on lodging .
similarly , the news of the election results of the north east states and the cricket match got a total update on the hike .
hike total has proved the app helpful to the common man by giving correct information of one of our brothers &apos; pnr states .
while star sign apps work on the total without an internet pack , a data pack will be required to transfer photos or images , audio and video files .
similarly , you will be able to see the headlines and short description of the news , but to read the whole news , an internet pack will be required .
super star data packs from hike total have also been introduced on this os .
they start at rs 1 , with 20 mb of data available .
this 20 mb data can play 100 photos or 5 audio songs or up to 4 minutes of video .
similarly , plans of 3 rupees , 5 rupees and 9 rupees are available .

this data can be used to watch more than 5000 photos or 300 audio songs or videos up to 4 hours .
this plan comes with 28 days validity .
hike &apos;s total service works on the ussd technology that is commonly used to find out mobile balances that involve writing code using stars and hashtags .
hike total is very easy to use which is easily operated .
like any ordinary smartphone , it has to be launched .
it will continue to show you 4g or 3g data connectivity according to the network coverage area even without having to pay data .
at the same time , when it came to use total services , the app looked a little sluggish here .
while star sign apps were taking time to open , the use of hike total wallet has also proved to be very slow .
hike total provides facilities and information without internet but these facilities are available only in short form , it can be called lack of app .
at the same time , to get detailed information about cricket or news , total will have to be recharged from the data packs of hike .
no instant messaging app in the country is offering services like hike total , this is what makes &apos; total &apos; different .
if you compromise on speed , then providing such facilities for free without charging 1 paise makes hike total special for the common user .
if you are working in the office or traveling somewhere , then listening to music on earphones is fine , but as soon as the four men sit , putting earphones there is equivalent to forcing friends to shout .
this is the reason why you are looking for a portable music player that is not only stylish but will add color to the party with better music .
recently launched a bluetooth music player named emoi mushroom , which is not only stylish to look at but is also better at bringing it somewhere due to being light and portable .
it has a built quality solid and you will also like it .
as the name suggests , it looks similar to the emoi mushroom music player mushroom which stands like a lamp on any plane surface .
on the other hand , the lamp above which you can call the hive also works for the lamp .
it has different types of lights which you can set as per your need .
the music player also has a light controller with a simple power button and volume controller .
you can set the light in two ways .
one is white and the other randomly different colors .
such as blue , pink and green etc .
at the same time , it can be said that you can change the light by touching a light mushroom .
if you have white light , just a slight dab on the mushroom can turn the light fast , medium and close .
at the same time , the color of the light will change by dab in multi light .
you will like the multi-light feature during the disco dance at night .
if you put it on the floor and there is a slight tremor , then the light will keep changing and you will enjoy it a lot .
you have seen the style , but if the music feature and quality in the music player is not good then it will not be fun .
emoi mushroom is equipped with bluetooth 4.0 .
although it has been a long time since bluetooth 5.0 , you can call it a shortcoming , but if you look at other music players , you will find that the same specifications are available at the moment .
infinix hot s3 review : big thing even in small budget
emoi mushroom music player also supports 360 degree sound with 360 degree light .
that is , there will be a kind of sound on any side of the music player .
it is capable of supporting almost all popular audio formats for music play .
at the same time , because of the 360 ​ ​ degree speaker , you can also use it in conference calling in the office .
works quite well .
raahi baat music has good sound quality .
can not say very well
yes , if you are listening in a room , the sound is so much that it can be heard from every corner .
the best we liked is battery backup .
once charged , you can listen to music comfortably for 5-6 hours .
this music player is also capable of supporting other os including android and ios .
the emoi mushroom music player is priced at rs 2,900 in the indian market .
seeing the price , it can be said that is a bit expensive .
yes you can spend so much for style .
at that time , mobile service was started in many countries of the world including in india .
phones were known only for calling and often used sms .
mobile users also used to pay heavy fees for calling with heavy phones .
meanwhile , a phone came which changed the style of mobile and a new trend phone was introduced .
it took some time to reduce the calling fee , but the style of the mobile definitely started changing from there .
yes , i am talking about the year of 1996 .
when nokia introduced its matrix phone nokia 8110 model 22 years ago .
slip out the phone from the pocket and remove it and talk in style .
this phone won the hearts of people .
now once again the company has introduced this iconic phone again .
however , you can also call the new nokia 8110 4g matrix phone a new-age feature phone .
whereas earlier the phone was limited to just calling and messaging , the new model supports 4g network and runs smart apps .
there is a lot of discussion about this phone and everyone wants to know how it is , so let us explain in detail about the new nokia 8110 4g matrix .
the body of nokia 8110 4g matrix phone is made of polycarbonate plastic .
the quality of the phone is very good and apart from the nokia matrix phone , it also reminds me of asha sariji .
the small phone has a keypad cover .
you can open the cover by sliding it down and it becomes a long phone .
the most important thing is that this phone is not even straight from the back , it is quite curved which fits in the palm .
the old phone had a monochrome display .
at the same time , the company has given a 2.45-inch qvga display .
you will be surprised to know that the screen is also curved along with the body of the phone .
operating system and software
this phone works on kios and many other apps will also be found in the phone including google maps .
at the same time , the company has claimed that you can enjoy social networking in it .
however , so far there is no specific information about whatsapp .
the nokia 8110 4g matrix has been called a smart feature phone by the company .
this phone has been introduced on qualco mm snapdragon 205 chipset .
the phone has 512 mb ram memory and 4 gb internal memory .
apart from this , there is also memory card support .
snake game
talking about nokia feature phones and not snake games , it is probably incomplete .
you will also get to play snake games in this phone .
photo , video , music
nokia 8110 4g matrix phone will also get fm radio support and music and video player .
at the same time , it is able to support almost all popular audio formats for music .
a 2-megapixel rear camera is provided with flash for photography .
4g support
this phone supports 4g and you can also do volte calling .
for power backup , this phone has a battery of 1,500 mah .
the company claims talktime of up to 9.3 hours for volte .
the standby time is 25 days .
the price of nokia 8110 4g matrix is ​ ​ 79 euro which is around 6,000 rupees as per indian price .
whenever there is mention of opo phone .
you would say that selfies are the best and it is not wrong to say that .
the company has introduced more than one selfie phone in the last few years .
at the same time , the recently launched opo f5 also leads the same segment .
but the company introduced the siddharth limited edition model of opo f5 a few days ago and if you believe this phone , then you will say that the company has launched a stylish selfie phone .
this phone is very stylish to watch and incidentally we also got it available for review .
during the usage of about seven days , we got to know a lot about this phone which has been mentioned further .
however , before that let me tell that bollywood actor siddharth malhotra is the brand ambassador of opo and the phone has been launched in his name .
although the opo f5 has been introduced in metal finish , but in the siddharth limited edition , the company has used glass in the back panel .
in the previous panel you will see metallic blue colored glass .
the phone is sleek and the built quality is also great .
it is also comfortable to hold because the corners are curved .
yes , where metal phones slip by hand , you will not have such problem in it .

hardware buttons will be found on the side of the phone .
the rear panel of the phone has a fingerprint sensor .
the fingerprint sensor is also in a mirror finish and a thin silver line is seen around it , which brings a slight variation in the uniform color and adds more charm .
the design of the opo f5 itself is very good .
at the same time , the new edition is even more beautiful .
the only drawback was that there were fingerprints on the back panel .
except for the look , the oppo f5 is similar to the old f5 in terms of the siddharth limited edition feature .

in the phone , you will get a 6-inch full hd + screen with 2,160 × 1,080 pixels resolution .

during an event organized by xiaomi in delhi , the company has introduced the redmi note 5 .
at the same time , the company has also given surprise in this event .
with the redmi note 5 , the redmi note 5 pro has been launched , which is much more powerful and smart .
in the indian market , the price of xiaomi redmi note 5 pro starts at rs 13,999 and it is available for sale at flipkart and mi india store online .
this device has been launched first in india , so everyone is eager to know about the phone .
next we have presented the first glimpse of this phone .
xiaomi redmi note 5 pro has been introduced in metal unibody design .
it is much slimmer than the redmi note 4 , so the age does not seem to be the whole curve .
above the screen in the main panel , the speaker has a camera on one side and a front flash with sensors on the other side .
the bottom part is completely empty .
there is no control button here .
in the rear panel , an upside-down dual camera will appear in iphone style .
there is a fingerprint scanner in the middle .
the camera is well above the body , so there will always be a risk of scratches .
the sim slot is on the left side while the volume and power buttons are given on the right .
the lower panel has a 3.5 mm audio jack , microusb and loudspeaker , while the voice cancellation and ir blaster are available at the top .
through the ir blaster you can control tv , ac and other electronics devices .
the design of the phone is solid and you will like it .
although the metal panel is very smooth , there will always be a fear of slipping by hand .
the xiaomi redmi note 5 pro has a full hd + screen with a 5.99-inch 18 : 9 aspect ratio and the phone &apos;s screen resolution is full hd + ( 2160 × 1080 pixels ) .
the display is very good and the touch response is also very good .
we did not find any problem even in the sun .
although we have used it for a while , we cannot tell much about it .
the xiaomi redmi note 5 pro has been introduced on the qualco mm snapdragon 636 chipset .
this is the first phone in the world that has been introduced on this chipset .
the phone has a 1.8 ghz octa-core processor .
adreno 509 gpu has been given in it for better graphics .
this phone is available with 4 gb and 6 gb ram memory .
however , in both models you will get 64 gb memory .

however , the second slot is hybrid where you can use either a sim or memory card .
as far as performance is concerned , at the moment we cannot say much but in the beginning it is working very smooth .
this phone works on the mui 9.5 which is based on android operating system 7.1 nougat .
this os will be called slightly older .
by swiping the screen from left to right in the phone , you will get a screen which the company has named app vault .
where you can put the necessary features which can be accessed quickly .
at the same time , the icon has become a bit flat already , due to which it appears more clean .
xiaomi redmi note 5 pro is equipped with a dual camera .
the phone has a 12-megapixel + 5-megapixel rear dual camera .
with the camera , you will get a bokeh effect called portrait mode or blur background .
apart from this , features like pro mode have been given .

bokeh effect has also been provided with the front camera .
xiaomi redmi note 5 pro has dual sim support and you can take advantage of 4g volte .

in this era of social media selfie has become so famous that today everyone posts selfie .
whether it is amitabh bachchan or balwood badshah shah rukh khan .
smartphone companies also understand this very well .
this is the reason that today the phone is equipped with a powerful selfie camera .
recently , chinese company infinix has also introduced its selfie phone in india . the company has launched hot s3 which has a 20 megapixel selfie camera .
with the launch , this phone became available to us and we soon wrote a review so that if you are planning to buy hot s3 then you can take the right decision .
the body of the
design infinix hot s3 is made of polycarbonate plastic .
however , we liked the built quality of the phone .
at the same time , the company has not compromised in terms of its looks .
it takes a lot to see this phone .
curved edges are provided in its back side , so it will not be left out by hand and is comfortable to hold .
the bottom of the phone has micro usb , speaker grill and mic .
there is a sim card port on the left and volume and power buttons are given on the right .
the 3.5 mm audio port is available on the top side .
apart from this , fingerprint sensor has been provided with the camera in the style of iphone 10 in its rear side .
on the main panel , the speaker grill , front camera with led flash and notification light are provided above the screen .
since this is a phone with a bezelless display , you will not find any control buttons under the screen .
the design is very good according to the overall budget .
yes , it can be said that it is a plastic body phone in the practice of metal phones .
display
infinix introduced the hot s3 with a new design trend display with 18 : 9 aspect ratios .
the phone has a 5.65-inch hd + display .
the screen resolution of the phone is 1440 c 720 pixels .
its colors look very good and you will also enjoy watching videos in full view display .
however , whenever the screen seemed to be slightly reflective , due to which you may have trouble in fast sunlight .
at the same time , fingerprints on the screen were also falling slightly .
the infinix hot s3 powers qualco mm &apos;s snapdragon 430 chipset .
the phone has a 1.4 ghz octa-core processor .
along with this , 3 gb ram and 32 gb internal storage is available .
the memory of the phone is expandable and you can use a memory card up to 128 gb .
however , let us tell you that its 4 gb ram variant is also available in which 64 gb of storage is available .
we had only 3 gb ram variant phone available for review .
we did not get any complaint from the phone &apos;s performance .
we played heavy games like asphalt 8 in it and it is capable of running easily .
yes , it may look slightly lagged during heavy graphics but will not be detected during normal use .
apart from this , there was no problem even during multitasking or browsing .
this infinix phone runs on xos which is based on android operating system 8.0 orea .
you will get to see all its applications on the home panel itself .
even though there will be many interesting features in it , it can be said that the company did not give more applications of waste in it .
there are very few phones in this range that are working on oreo , so in terms of os , it will be said ahead of its competitors .
the infinix hot s3 has a 13-megapixel rear and a 20-megapixel rear camera .
with both front and back cameras , you will get dual tone led flash light .
since the company has introduced it as a selfie phone and it can be said that its selfie is very good .
in its budget , it can be called the best selfie phone .
although after a good selfie , we were expecting a better picture than the rear camera , but the result was average there .
its dual tone led will be of great help during low light .
for data and connectivity , this phone has 4g volte with dual sim .
apart from this , wifi and usb otg support will also be available .
microusb port has been given in the phone .
this phone of infinix hot s3 is available with a large 4,000 mah lithium ion battery battery .
the battery backup of the phone is very good .
once fully charged it is able to take a day and a half of rest .
at the same time , in our video lup test , it lasted more than 14 hours which would be called quite good .
as we said , it has two models .
the 3 gb ram variant is priced at rs 8,999 .
whereas for the variant with 4 gb ram , you have to pay rs 10,999 .
you can buy infinix hot s3 from e-commerce website flipkart .
even if you find the phone with 4g ram a bit expensive , you can buy a phone with 3 gb ram without any hesitation .
in this budget , phones like infocus vision 3 and redmi y1 are expected to get a tough competition but they are far ahead in features .
last year , opo introduced the a71 model and this company has launched its upgraded version opo a71 2018 .
the price of this phone in the indian market is 9,990 rupees .
although opo is mainly known for offline stores , but this time the company has also placed the a71 on the online platform .
with the launch , this phone also became available to us and without delay , we have brought the first glimpse of this phone for you .
so that you can get a good idea about the phone .
the body of the opo a71 is made of polycarbonate .
although it has been introduced in metallic finish , this will give you a feeling of mantle in the look and the grip .
the build quality is good and its slim body looks quite attractive .
intex elite dual : a true deal for selfie lovers ,
a 5.2-inch lcd ips screen at a low-cost all-rounder performance opo a71 ( 2018 ) .
the phone &apos;s screen resolution is 1,280 x 720 pixels .
the company has not provided information about screen protection .
we liked the display and the touch feeling is also fine .
honor view 10 : creates a killer look after the specific specification under the special
screen you will see three capacitive touch android buttons which are in almost all android phones .
first look of honor 9 lite : you will die on its look you
have the opo a71 introduced on color os 3.2 , which is based on the android operating system 7.1 nougat .
you will see the apps on the home panel itself .
at the same time , quick settings will be found by swiping the screen down .
the company has introduced it on snapdragon 450 chipset and has a 1.8 ghz octa-core processor .
along with this , there is 3 gb ram and 16 gb internal memory .
the phone has memory card support up to 256 gb .
if you like gaming in the phone , then there is also an adreno 506 gpu for better graphics .
talking about photography segment , the 13-megapixel rear camera with f / 2.2 aperture with led flash has been given on the back panel of the phone .
the rear camera of this phone is equipped with multi frame technology and ultra hd technology .
flash is available with the camera .
the oppo a71 has a 5-megapixel selfie camera .
although you can underestimate it in terms of megapixels , the company has equipped it with ai beautification technology like the opo f5 , which adjusts the color itself according to the screen , color and gender .
oppo a71 ( 2018 ) dual sim phone that supports 4g volte .
the special thing can be said that you can use a memory card with two sims in the phone .
micro usb 2.0 has been given for data and connectivity .
on the lower panel , you will see usb .
while the upper panel has a 3.5 mma audio jack .
for power backup , it has a 3,000 mah battery .
the phone is also available with a manpower , power adapter , usb cable and earphone with a sales pack .
it is said that technology changes very fast and this limit is even smaller in mobile technology .
you can also notice that the technology you would have seen in tv a few years back is still running today , but the technology that was seen in mobile last year has changed this year .
just like last year , there was more talk of 4g volte and video calling , whereas now we talk about bezel less display and dual camera .
cameras have been the biggest attraction in mobile phones since the beginning .
earlier , the phone used to have a vga camera , but later the battle of megapixels started .
after some time , the front camera was also seen and the crease of the selfie started to speak .
even after this , many great innovations have been seen with the camera and today dual camera phones remain a topic of discussion .
dual cameras started with expensive phones , but today these phones are available even in cheap budgets .
recently , the indian mobile phone manufacturer intex has also introduced the dual-camera phone intex elite dual at a price of rs 6,999 .
although the chinese market is dominated by the indian market today , but seeing this smartphone equipped with the best specifications of intex , it is being said that it is capable of competing with any phone in this budget .
this phone was also available to us for review and we also tried to check how well this phone met the expectations of the customers . the main usp of intex elite dual is its dual selfie camera .
therefore , we start the review of the phone only with its camera segment .
there are two camera sensors on the front panel of the phone which is 8-megapixels and 2-megapixels .
to take good photos in low light , led flash is provided in the front .
the front camera setup of the phone is equipped with the bokeh effect and also features beauty filters .
with the selfie camera in the intact elite dual , we liked the bokeh effect experience .
in this , you can reduce and increase the blur background according to your needs .
at the same time , beauty filters are also excellent , which make the selfie soft and interactive .
while the selfie taken with the flashlight was more close to capturing more closely , all kinds of selfies were captured very well from an average distance .
the back panel of the phone also has an 8-megapixel rear camera with led flash , which is equipped with features such as color effects , breast mode , night shot .
photos taken from the rear camera showed a lack of color sharpness .
in the day , whether the photo was taken from a distance or the closeup of an object , the photo appears to be a bit dull in both the conditions .
at the same time , low light photos have been relatively average due to led flash .
the slight problem we encountered with the camera was that the camera was taking too long in focus .
the object was taking a little time to focus while clicking the photo in intact elite dual .
in such a situation , you will have to hold the phone very carefully .
today , where unibody phones are seen more , the back cover can be opened in elite dual and the battery can be removed .
the back cover of the phone is of polycarbonate plastic .
there is no physical button on the front panel of elite dual .
the phone has three capacitive keys and a volume rocker and power button are provided on the right panel .
the back edge is curved and the antenna band is given on both the top and bottom .
we had the black color variant of elite dual which looked quite attractive to watch .
the glass coating on the front panel shows the display slightly embossed on the side of the side , making it attractive .
there is no port or hole on the upper panel in the phone .
the 3.5 mm jack and usb port are present on the bottom panel of the phone .
the design of the phone is good in terms of budget but we did not feel new .
we have seen such phones in the past as well .
intex elite dual has a 5-inch hd ips display with 1280 x 720 pixels resolution .
the company has introduced it with 2.5d curved glass .
the display of the phone is quite bright and saturated .
despite the low budget , the colors look quite sharp .
at the same time , there was also no visibility problem during chatting and playing games in the sunlight , which would be called a good thing .
it can be said that the display of the phone gets fingerprints in the use of some time , which will surprise you during use somewhere .
however , the better touch of the phone makes up this shortcoming .
its touch screen is smooth and fast .
intex elite dual has 16 gb of internal storage with 2 gb of ram memory .
the memory of the phone can be increased up to 128 gb via microsd card .
for processing , it has been introduced on the spreadtrum sc 9850 chipset and the phone has a quad-core processor with a speed of 1.3 ghz .
at the same time , mali 400 gpu is available for graphics .
the phone has two sim slots and a memory card support .
both of them work on the sim 4g network in the phone .
talking about processing performance , the processing of the phone has felt a bit slow .
it has taken some time to touch and open any app icon .
at the same time , when the phone was connected to wifi , there was a problem here .
intex elite dual has been introduced by the company on the android operating system 7.0 nugget .
intex has introduced this phone without any other layer or user interface , hence elite dual can be called pure android phone .
as already mentioned , the processing slowed down somewhere during use but this phone did not hang in about 20 days of usage .
the special thing was found in elite dual that the number of preloaded applications in it is very less .
that is , users will get enough space to download the application of their choice .
the swift keyboard of the phone gives a good user experience .
at the same time , the data back app in the phone gives the user up to 500 mb of space to backup the data for free .
intex elite dual has two sim card slots and a microsd card slot .
this phone supports 4g volte and both sims in the phone can run internet at 4g speed .
but you can use data on only one sim at a time .
the phone also has a usb otg port along with wifi and bluetooth so that you can connect the pen drive or hard drive to the phone .
yes , fingerprint sensor is not provided in this phone , which can be called a major drawback , whereas intex itself has a fingerprint scanner in the budget phone of rs 4,000 .
intex elite dual has a 2,400 mah battery for power backup .
the phone does not have fast charging support .
it took about 1 hour for the battery to be fully charged .
the battery backup of the phone is a bit weak .
once fully charged , ordinary calling , messaging , internet , and using the camera do not take a full day off .
the intex elite dual is priced at rs 6,999 .
the company has introduced this phone as a selfie centric smartphone .
during the usage of about 20 days , we found that this phone is much better in this range in terms of taking a selfie .
although the rear camera disappoints slightly , the front camera setup is excellent .
the look of the phone is also good to see .
slow processing and weak battery backup can be an impediment in its path .
looking at all aspects , it can be said that if you are fond of selfie then this phone is best for you .
at the moment , there is hardly anyone to launch a dual-camera phone that can match the huawei brand .
if we look at the company &apos;s last two years portfolio , you will find that huawei has brought dual rear camera wall phones in the budget of rs 10,000 to rs 30,000 .
at the same time , the company has brought another phone in the honor series .
however , this time the company &apos;s flagship phone has been named honor view 10 .
it was performed in london in early december and was introduced in india by the end of the same .
in the initial week of january , this phone became available for sale where it is priced at rs 29,999 .
there are phones like oneplus 5t , nokia 8 and xiaomi mi mix in this budget .
in such a situation , the challenge for honor view 10 is no less .
during our 10 days of testing , we also tried to know whether this phone is the best in its budget or whether it would be better to rely on oneplus 5t .
there is no doubt that this phone will make your own crazy at first sight .
metallic blue colored body and shiny front panel is very attractive to watch and you will pick it up when you see it .
the phone has been introduced in full body metal design .
the finest aluminum material design available makes this phone a slick to see .
where today the curved back panel is in practice .
at the same time , its rear panel is absolutely flat .
yes , like two eyes , two cameras come out of the body and in such a situation , there is always a risk of scratching them .
in honor view 10 , antenna bands are given on the top and bottom side like the iphone .
the most important thing that can be said is that the company has introduced it with a flower view screen .
despite this , the physical home button is below the screen and the fingerprint scanner is also given on the same .
overall , the design of the phone seems premium and it is capable of making expensive phones feel .
in honor view 10 , you will get a full view screen with 5.99-inch fullhd + 18 : 9 ratio .
the screen resolution of the phone is 1080 x 2160 pixels .
the screen is quite bright and you can easily see things .
there will be no problem even in harsh sunlight .
its large screen size will be said to be good enough for those who watch more gaming and videos .
although the company has not yet given information about screen protection .
in this case , this small deficiency can be called .
yes , as far as display quality is concerned , it cannot be said back from the oneplus 5t and mi mix 2 available in this range .
but if you do it with samsung galaxy s8 or lg &apos;s flagship phone , then there is no match .
despite this , according to its budget is better .
first look of samsung galaxy a8 + , low price premium look
honor view 10 is offered on the huawei kirin 970 chipset .
along with this , the phone has a 2.4 ghz octa-core processor .
it also has 6 gb of ram and 128 gb of internal storage .
yes , it is important to mention here that in this phone , the company has used ai ie artificial intelligence based chipset which will display things according to your style of work .
for example , if you have set go to sleep mode and are reading the article , then the screen will not be off .
yes as soon as you leave reading it will enter slip mode .
the best use of ai will be seen during camera usage .
this phone is very fast and you can play games for hours in it .
we did not get complaints of getting hot .
during the experiment we played games with big graphics like modern combat and the experience was quite good .
for photography , honor view 10 has a 16-megapixel + 20-megapixel dual rear camera .
the phone has a sensor aperture f / 1.8 which gives the assurance of clicking good photos in low light .
it also has a 16-megapixel front camera that comes with options such as portrait mode and moving picture .
apart from all this , options like pro photo and pro video will also be available .
pro is the manual mode where you can control the shutter and aperture yourself .
it also has options like beauty mode during photography .
the blur effect of the phone works quite well .
seeing this , it can be said that honor is getting better with every dual camera phone .
in the phone , you can use the rest of the effects with beauty mode .
at the same time , if you take a photo in white angle mode , after clicking the picture , you can set the blur background , which is quite nice .
as we have already mentioned that it has been enabled with ai feature and it works even better during photography .
it adjusts the light and color by itself , which makes the picture even better .
if you talk about a selfie camera , here too you can use the bokeh effect .
this phone works on emui which is based on android operating system 8.0 oreo .
with os you will get good themes and wallpapers .
along with this , the company has also given some good options as it has a game mode .
if you enable and play the game then it will block the incoming call so that you can enjoy the game without stopping .
apart from this , you can also change the screen resolution .
apart from this , good features like file safe and screen recording will also be available in the phone .
it has a navigation dock , a round button will come on the screen as soon as it comes on , which works only for the back and home screen .
if you want to enable it , you can remove the navigation button below so that you can use the whole screen .
if we were to decrease the stock then we would have said better .
apart from this , it also has nfc , infrared port , gyroscope sensor and otg .
however the second slot is hybrid where you can use only one of the sims or cards .
in this , you get 3,750 mah battery , which according to the company is capable of charging 58 percent in just 30 minutes .
although the battery backup of the phone is excellent .
after fully charged , it is able to take a full day even after heavy use .
this phone is available in the indian market for rs 29,999 and in this budget we will call it a very good phone .
if you like stock android more then you probably can &apos;t say it otherwise it can be called the best phone of your budget in terms of look , performance and specification .
today , if you go shopping for a phone in a budget segment of 5,000 to 10,000 rupees , then most people will recommend you xiaomi redmi 4 .
it is difficult to match this phone of xiaomi in this budget .
but recently , smartron has introduced t.phone p in india which is not only powerful in specification but also due to its price , remains a topic of discussion .
in such a situation , the question for the common user is whether it is better to take smartron &apos;s phone or whether the choice of tri and tested redmi 4 will be better .
smartron t.phone p was also available to us for review and we also tried to find the answer to these questions .
before proceeding about the phone , let me tell that smartron is the same company , then last year sanchin tendulkar came into the discussion by launching the phone .
now the company has entered the budget segment with smartron t.phone p.
the price of this phone in the indian market is rs 7,999 and it is available for sale on online store flipkart .
talking about the design of the phone , it can be said that in today &apos;s era of big phones , it is a compact phone that the company has introduced with solid built .
smartron t.phone p will make you feel quality only when you take it in hand .
the phone has been introduced in full metal unibody design .
the back panel of the phone is slightly curved , so it gives a very good feeling in the grip .
in the previous panel you will see the antenna band at the top and bottom .
at the same time , there is a camera and flash light on the band at the top , while a little fingerprint sensor will be found below .
there are no hardware buttons on the home panel of the phone . three capacitive touch buttons are provided .
in the side panel you will see hardware buttons and slots .
we have no complaints with the design of the phone but can say that there is no newness in it .
similar to ordinary android phones launching in today &apos;s trend .
the smartron t.phone p has a 5.2-inch hd screen .
the phone &apos;s screen resolution is 1280 x 720 pixels .
the display quality of the phone is good and the touch feel is also good .
yes , it can be said that the company has not talked about screen coating .
however , in a few days of usage , we did not see any scratch anywhere on the screen .
yes , the screen definitely looks a bit dull .
the phone has an auto brightness setting and sets itself according to the light .
you will get more benefit from this in strong sunlight .
brightness itself gets sharper so that you can see the screen clearly .
oneplus 5t review : not only do you say flagship killer
the smartron t.phone p works on a qualco mm snapdragon 435 chipset and the phone has a 1.4 ghz 64-bit octa-core processor .
the phone has microsd card support and you can expand the memory up to 128 gb .
at the same time , it can be said that with this , the company has also given 1,000 gb of cloud storage for free .
in addition to google drive in the phone , you can also use your phone cloud from the phone .
this qualco mm processor is great for multitasking and handling odd jobs .
we opened many apps simultaneously and used many tabs in the browser as well .
it was working properly but you cannot call it special for gaming .
during the experiment , we were playing a game with big graphics like asphalt 8 and it was correcting the play but the game launch time was slightly longer .
the good thing can be said that during gaming , we did not get much problem of heating the phone .
in terms of software , smartron &apos;s phone is based on android operating system 7.1 android operating system .
the company has not done much customization in the os and is close to stock android .
although android oreo would have been better .
some of the company &apos;s own apps including t-cloud and t-store are preloaded in the phone .
along with this , google and microsoft apps will also be found .
during the operation of the phone , we did not find any lag and it was working smooth .
in the smartron t.phone p , the company has given a 13-megapixel f / 2.2 aperture rear camera .
at the same time , the phone also has a 5-megapixel front camera for selfie .
you will get flash with rear camera .
the company has introduced beauty , panorama and bristle modes .
it also has the option of point and shoot where you can touch the screen and take a photo .
if you have a little knowledge about photography then it has manual mode where you can set iso , shutter speed and exposure by yourself .
as for the camera quality , if you are viewing the picture taken from the phone on the phone itself , you probably will not like it much and as we had already said , the screen looks a bit dull , so the photo will also be dull .
but if you look at another pc or screen , you will like the quality .
at the same time , the selfie camera is also fine .
looking at the budget , we cannot hope for better .
low light photography was having a few dots .
dual sim based smartron t.phone p has given you micro usb 2.0 for data and connectivity .
there is wifi bluetooth and 4g volte support .
it has a cow given the gyro scope .
the phone has a loudspeaker grill in the lower panel .
in such a situation , even if you put the phone somewhere , the sound does not suppress .
as far as sound quality is concerned , it is good on loudspeakers .
after seeing everything , it comes to battery backup , then it can be said with the claim that you will not be disappointed here .
this phone is available with a 5,000 mah battery .
if you use your phone on average , it removes two days comfortably .
the one drawback here will be that there is no fast charging despite the large battery .
it takes about two and a half to three hours to fully charge it .
ultimately it comes whether the smartron t.phone p is good for rs 7,999 or whether it would be better to go to some other option .
so let me tell you that by looking at this phone you will not say wow , but if you look at the specification of the phone according to the budget , then it will not be called either .
if you compare it with the xiaomi phone , then it will get almost equal in performance .
at the same time , it proves a little ahead in price and specification .
in december itself , honor introduced the view 10 smartphone .
with strong specifications , this phone is also very stylish to watch .
at the same time , the discussion of another phone of the company is in full swing in india .
huawei brand honor is going to introduce honor 9 lite in india on 17 january .
incidentally , this phone was also available to us before launch and without delay , we have brought the first glimpse of this phone for you .
the number of things you will talk about the design after watching honor 9 lite is minimal .
the phone has been introduced in front and back glass design .
the side panel is of metal .
the company has introduced it with flower view display , so there is no button under the screen and fingerprint sensor is also given in the previous panel .
the thickness of the phone is only 7.6  mm and it feels quite slick .
introduced in small and compact design , it easily fits into your palm .
it is often seen in glass back panel phones that there are many fingerprints .
in such a case , the company has introduced it with a special type of coating , it reduces that mark to a great extent .
this coating is done on both the front and back panels and you will see its effect .
overall , it can be said that the design is very impressive and it is one of the best looking phones .
honor view 10 first look : a stunning look with strong specifications
in honor 9 lite , you will see a 5.65-inch screen .
the phone has been introduced with 1080 x 2160 hd + screen resolution .
at the beginning of the phone we liked it and have not used much yet , so we cannot talk more .
the company has not provided information about gorilla glass or dragon trail coating .
honor 9 lite has been introduced by the company on the chipset of huawei itself .
this phone runs on the highsilicon kirin 659 chipset and has a 2.36 ghz cortex a53 octa-core processor .
along with this , the mali-t830mp2 gpu has been equipped for better graphics .
this phone is available with 3 gb and 4 gb memory variants and in this you will get 32 ​ ​ gb and 64 gb internal memory .
although the phone &apos;s memory is expandable , but its second slot is highbreid where you can use only one of the sim and microsd cards .
huawei introduced honor 9i a few months ago with four cameras available .
at the same time , the company has also introduced honor 9 lite with four camera options .
this phone has a 13-megapixel + 2-megapixel rear camera .
in addition , only 13-megapixel + 2-megapixel secondary is available .
you will be able to take pictures in portrait mode from both camera setups .
there is an led flash on the back and a soft selfie flash is provided on the front panel .
at the same time , with the main camera , you are given options like pro mode and you can control the aperture and shutter manually .
however , we will give you information about picture quality during the review .
this phone of honor works on emotion ui 8.0 which is android nougat based on operating system 8.0 .
in this , you will see apps on the home panel itself .
options like huawei share and mirror will be available .
the phone has a mirror app inside the tools that will work for you as a mirror .
the front camera becomes active as soon as you turn it on and you can decorate it right there .
it can be zoomed and can also increase brightness .
in honor 9 lite , you will find 3,000 mah lithium polymer battery .
the company claims better battery backup .
in this dual sim based phone , you will get wifi support with 4g volte .
at the same time , the company has equipped it with micro usb 2.0 .
although the company has not yet given the price information , it is expected that it will be offered between rs 15,000 – 17,000 .
after several days of church , samsung finally introduced the galaxy a8 + in india .
this phone will be available for sale on online store amazon india from january 20 , where it is priced at 32,990 .
there is a lot of church about this phone and users also want to know .
incidentally , we also have the samsung galaxy a8 + available for review , and before a long review , we have brought you its first glimpse .
the samsung galaxy a8 + is made of body metal and glass combination .
the phone is very attractive to watch .
the built quality of the phone is good but we did not feel very slim .
this phone is very much like the flagship s8 .
even though it did not provide curved edges , but due to the full vision display , width , curves and glass back panel , it looks like galaxy s8 at first glance .
because of the full vision display , it does not have any button on the home panel .
along with this , dual cameras and notification led lights will be available on the screen .
at the same time , samsung logo , single led flash light and single rear camera have been given on the rear panel .
you can see that while the fingerprint sensor was given next to the flash in the galaxy note 8 and galaxy s8 , it has a down side .
the advantage of being down is that the fingers easily reach the fingerprint sensor .
volume buttons and a sim slot are given on the left side .
while the second sim slot is given upwards and there is also a microsd card slot .
apart from this , power buttons and speakers are available on the right side .
earlier in j7 prime , we have seen the speaker in the side panel .
because of the speaker on the side , the voice does not suppress while listening to the song .
at the bottom you will find usb type-c and 3.5 mm ports .
samsung galaxy a8 + has been equipped with a full hd + super amoled screen with 6-inch 18.5 : 9 aspect ratio .
the company has used 2.5d curved glass which is coated with corning gorilla glass .
the display of the phone is very good .
colors are sparkling and you will be able to see it without any trouble in the hot sun .
even in the beginning , its touch was very smooth .
the galaxy a8 + has been introduced by samsung &apos;s own exynos 7885 chipset .
the phone has a 2.2 ghz octa-core processor .
although this processor is said to be equivalent to qualco mm &apos;s 660 series processors which are available in mid-range phones but 6 gb of ram makes up its shortcomings .
however , we will not talk about the performance right now , because it is too early .
the company has introduced it with 64 gb of internal storage which is expandable up to 256 gb .
the good thing can be said that dedicated memory is a card slot .
where you can use a memory card with two sims .
cult ambition : big specification - small performance
you also expect a bigger battery with a bigger display but the company has given a 3,500 mah battery in it .
if it is not very big , we cannot say anything .
let us tell you that the samsung galaxy a8 + has a 16-megapixel + 8-megapixel dual front camera .
the company has equipped it with features like bixby vision , live focus and ar stickers .
the phone &apos;s camera is equipped with f / 1.9 aperture .
see , it is better than selfie brands like oppo and vivo and you will be able to click pictures with blur background .
at the same time , its rear camera is 16-megapixels .
which the company has equipped with f / 1.7 aperture .
the company claims that this phone is capable of clicking great photos even in low rosini .
the samsung galaxy a8 plus android operating system works on 7.1 nougat .
in the phone , you will find features such as face recognition , multi-window , dual apps and bixby voice assistant .
something special
samsung galaxy a8 + also has nfc , gyro scope , active voice cancellation , bluetooth 5.0 , fm radio and otg .
at the same time , the most important thing can be said that this phone is ip 67 certified .
that is , this phone is water and dust inhibitor .
the market of 4g volte smartphones getting at a low price is growing rapidly in india these days .
in this series , the tech company cult has also launched another new device cult ambition in the market after introducing smartphones like beyond and gladiators .
at a price of rs 5,999 , this phone has become available for sale on amazon india .
let &apos;s know how is this phone .
cult ambition is offered with black and green color thim .
the special thing is that the phone box and the manual and guide available in it were also available in black and green color .
in this box you get an ambition handset , a battery , a usb , an adapter and a quick support guide .
the body of cult ambition is made of polycarbonate which makes you feel mantle .
the back panel of the phone can be removed and its battery can also be removed .
let me tell you that very few smartphones can see removable batteries nowadays .
the design of the phone is compact and easily fits into the palm .
the rear camera setup with led flash is provided on the back panel of the phone , which is on the upper right .
fingerprint sensor is present on the back panel itself .
however , we found the size of the fingerprint sensor a bit small .
similarly , on the front panel of the phone , there is a selfie camera sensor on one side of the microphone , while the flash light is given on the other side .
the placement of the selfie camera will be called good .
however , in today &apos;s slim phone era , it seems a bit thick .
the phone has a 5-inch hd ips display with 1280 × 720 pixel resolution which is protected with 2.5d curved glass .
in this range , phones are available with this display .
however the color production of the phone is good and the touch response also got better .
but there are fingerprints on the screen and you also have some difficulty in display in hard sunlight .
cult ambition has been introduced on the mediatek mt 6737 chipset .
the phone has a 1.25 ghz quadcore processor with 64 bits .
the phone has 32 gb of internal storage with 3 gb of ram , which can be expanded up to 32 gb .
as far as performance is concerned , we felt a bit slow .
it was taking a little time even for apps to open or for any other work .
at the same time , the phone takes a little longer to turn on power .
this phone works on android operating system 7.0 .
the phone &apos;s ui is very similar to the stock .
at the same time , the company has introduced it with many preloaded apps .
amazon prime and opera mini pre are downloaded in cult ambition as well as google services .
it does not take much time for the inbuilt apps in the phone to be open .
there was no lag problem even in the menu slide or scrolling .
amazon prime and opera mini are pre-loaded in cult ambition as well as google services .
however , you can install some of these apps .
the phone has a 13-megapixel rear camera for photography , which comes with beauty and panorama features .
in this , along with the screen mode , color effects will also be seen , which is helpful in taking good photos in different lights and weather .
at the same time , to reduce the extra noise with video recording , it also has a noise reduction feature .
the phone &apos;s selfie camera is 5-megapixel , which is equipped with a flashlight .
this camera also comes with beauty mode .
the front camera has all the features of the rear camera .
the picture quality of the phone is simple .
at the same time , the combination of colors also felt quite different from reality .
cult ambition has a go2play feature that works as a digital wallet .
at the same time , it has a night mode feature , which is better if you use it to read something on the screen at night .
this phone has dual sim support and can take advantage of 4g .
the good thing can be said that you can use a microsd card with dual sim .
the phone has a micro usb charger .
the cult ambition battery is 2,600 mah .
the battery backup of the phone is good but not much better .
at the same time , it also takes a little longer to charge .
overall , this phone seems to be at the forefront of specification , but in performance , xiaomi redmi 5a and micromax are slightly behind india .
whenever a device of oneplus is launched in india , the movement of this flagship killer phone is not less than apple iphone or samsung galaxy note series .
if you are interested about the phone , then definitely mention oneplus .
but the question is why it is called the flagship killer .
so let me tell you that this phone is not only ahead in the specifications and features by these flagship phones but also the price is half .
that is , the features in the phone are premium but the price is half that of expensive branded phones .
the recently launched oneplus 5t is also similar .
this phone was also available to us for testing and in about 1 month of use , we wanted to know everything about this phone and whatever conclusion came before you .
a few months ago the company launched oneplus 5 .
it was a stylish phone and the company has tried to capitalize on the same popularity with the oneplus 5t .
although this time the company has introduced it in bezel lace design and even slightly larger than the old phone but many things have been taken from the old phone .
in this too , you will find the antenna band at the top and bottom like the apple iphone .
the rear also has slightly more rounds .
the entire body of the phone is made of metal whose quality is superb .
on the front panel , you will see only the screen , while the back panel has camera , flash , fingerprint sensor and company logo .
it is slick to see and the panel is curved which makes it comfortable to hold .
overall , the look of the phone will attract you .
as far as i am concerned , due to the small body , i liked to hold oneplus 5 more .
yes , in terms of quality , i cannot say anything behind .
it is able to make you feel premium quality .
oneplus 5t is equipped with a 6-inch 18 : 9 aspect ratio bezel lace display by the company .
the phone &apos;s screen resolution is 1,080 × 2,160 pixels full hd + and the company has used 2.5d curved glass .
the company has used full optic amoled display .
the phone &apos;s screen is protected with corning gorilla glass 5 .
overall , it can be said that everything has been given in it .
regarding the display quality , there is no doubt that it has become very good already .
the performance of colors and textures is very clear .
even if you use it for a long time , the eyes will be relaxed and there will be no problem .
at the same time it has auto brightness mode and believe it works very well .
according to the external illumination , the screen adjusts itself so that there is not much weight on the eyes .
at the same time , it has a night mode , which is very helpful while reading something on mobile at night .
the phone has been introduced on qualco mm snapdragon 835 chipset .
this is one of the best chipsets of the year 2017 .
along with this , the phone has a 2.45 ghz kryo processor .
along with this , the company has equipped the adreno 540 gpu for better graphics experience .
oneplus 5t has been introduced in two variants , one is available in 64 gb storage with 6 gb ram and the other is 128 gb storage with 8 gb ram .
it does not have memory card support .
we had a model with 8 gb ram .
however , even if you do not use anything in the phone , about 3.3 gb of ram is still in use .
despite this , a lot of ram is empty and you will not have any problem .
there are always simple tasks in the phone such as 8 – 10 tabs in the browser and 8 – 10 apps simultaneously .
there was no problem in this .
the phone has both ram and memory .
the same good thing can be said that in this we played a heavy game and also watched videos for a long time but there was no complaint of heating up .
there was a oneplus 5 with a similar processor and we liked it a little bit .
talking about software , you may get some disappointment here .
oneplus 5t runs on oxygen os 4.7 , which is based on android operating system 7.1.1 nougat .
it has been a long time since android os 8.0 came to oreo , in such a situation , we were hoping for oreo too .
however , the company has assured to deliver orio soon .
although the good thing can be said that it is close to stock android , in this case you will get a cleaner and better ui .
in addition to google , two amazon apps will be available in the phone .
it does not have much preloaded apps which is good .
there is not much to tell here .
oneplus 5t dual rear camera is for photography .
oneplus 5 also had dual camera setup but its camera is more powerful .
the phone has a 20-megapixel sony imx 398 sensor with f / 1.7 aperture and the second sensor is 16-megapixel with f / 1.7 aperture .
the company has given sony imx 371 sensor .
the company has not used telephoto this time but low light photography has become much better .
like the old phone , this phone also has a 16-megapixel front camera with f / 2.0 aperture for selfie .
it has a depth mode where you can blur the background by focusing the subject .
eia ( electronic image stabilization ) feature has been provided with the phone , which is helpful in taking clear pictures even when the hands are moving .
in this , you are able to support up to 2x optical zoom .
apart from portrait mode , it will get options such as pro mode , slow motion and type laps .
pro is its manual mode where you can set shutter speed and aperture by yourself .
as far as picture quality is concerned , it was quite impressive .
at the same time , bokeh effect and low light photography have also become quite spectacular .
but you cannot call it the best camera phone .
pixel 2 and note 8 proved to be much better .
however , they are far ahead in price .
oneplus 5t has dual sim support and can use 4g volte in both sims .
however , only one sim will be active for data at a time .
apart from this , nfc , wifi and bluetooth will also be available .
the phone has usb type-c connectivity which is known for fast data transfer .
oneplus has a face recognition with a fingerprint sensor .
where the fingerprint sensor was below the screen in the previous phone , this time it is in the back panel and is quite fast .
at the same time , we also liked seeing the face recognition , many times it unlocked the phone even in the dark .
it is very fast there .
yes , it fails twice a day but for the first time it has been used and we liked it very much .
for power backup , this phone has a battery of 3,300 mah .
the company has made the battery larger than before .
for fast charging , the company has equipped it with a dash charger .
despite a large battery , it is fully charged in about an hour .
but this time it is a joy that the battery backup is excellent and is able to easily last a full day even after continuous use .
in a word can be concluded that this phone is very good and worth shopping .
the design , features and performance are better , as well as the price , you cannot say much .
if you want to compare it with oneplus 5 also , despite having a better display , bigger battery and better camera , the price is kept the same as that of the old phone .
it is the best all-rounder phone in the budget of rs 40,000 .
a few months ago , chinese smartphone maker comio knocked in india .
the company had launched three phones simultaneously .
at the same time , the company has started the made in india phone .
under this , the first phone comio c2 has been introduced .
the price of this phone launched in low budget is rs 7,199 .
after the launch of comio c2 , the company claimed that more than 20,000 of their phones have been sold in just 2 weeks .
and with this , it was said that this phone will be able to compete with the smartphones introduced in this segment of xiaomi .
over the course of about two weeks of use , we also tested the comio c2 and its capabilities and drawbacks to know how much this phone launched at a low price fits your pocket as well as expectations , let &apos;s learn :
the comio c2 is one of the few smartphones of today , whose back panel can be unlocked .
the body of this phone is made of polycarbonate and the back cover is plastic which is in rubberized matte finish .
a 3.5 mm jack is present on the upper panel and a usb slot is provided at the bottom .
the company has introduced c2 in royal black and royal blue colors .
we had a royal blue phone available for testing .
a golden color finish has been given around the phone .
comio logo on the back panel and rear camera in gold color circle has been given .
the usb port is likewise highlighted with gold color .
overall , this phone of comio is the best looking phone in this budget in terms of look .
the design is brand new and will give you a fresh look .
it is also very comfortable to hold due to the rubberized back panel .
the comio c2 is offered on a 5-inch ips hd display with 1280 × 720 pixels resolution .
the display of the phone is quite bright and the color is very sharp .
you get good picture quality while watching videos and playing games on youtube .
however , when we used this phone in the sun , the result of visibility came out poorly and there was difficulty in seeing the display content in the sunlight .
that is , the indoor display will support you but in the out door you will complain with the display .
there is no information about coated protection on the display but the touch of the phone is smooth and fingerprints and prices and spots are easily cleared on the screen .
along with the phone , the company is giving a screen replacement warranty for 6 months .
comio c2 has 2 gb of ram and 16 gb of internal storage .
the phone &apos;s storage can be expanded up to 128 gb via microsd card .
this phone has been introduced on the mediatek mtk 6737 chipset and the phone has a quad-core processor with 1.3 ghz clock speed .
for better graphics , the mali-t720 gpu has been given in this phone .
this phone has 16 gb internal storage .
in this budget , the same number of memory phones are available .
but if it were 32 gb , it would have been called fantastic
talking about the processing of the phone , there is no shortage in its performance .
talking about gaming or watching internet video at 4g speed , the phone has worked smooth and lag free in both cases .
if you play games with highgraphics , there may be some frame lag .
the comio c2 comio ui-based android operating system is launched on 7.0 nougat .
although the company has not said anything about the oreo update in this , 7.0 nugget will also not be called bad .
as already mentioned during the use , we have not seen any problem of hang .
talking about comio &apos;s user interface , it is quite clean .
the company has not filled it with unnecessary layers .
the &apos; freezer &apos; app has been given in the phone .
apps that are not being used for a long time can be added to the &apos; freezer &apos; app .
similarly , the &apos; speed up &apos; feature is also present in the phone .
this feature makes the phone fast by deleting the cache memory and temperature files of the phone with a single click .
similarly , the &apos; thim &apos; app on the home screen can change the entire thim of the phone with a single click .
all the length of the phone is fantastic .
start the camera segment of comio c2 with its rear camera , here the camera sensor is given in the middle on the top side of the back panel .
camera placement is considered better than side placement .
the phone has an 8-megapixel rear camera with a 5p lens .
the led flash is present on the rear panel and is equipped with features such as auto focus and panorama mode .
beauty mode and auto filters are also provided with the rear camera .
talking about photography , the result of the rear camera will not be called good .
the photos captured with this camera , day or night , were slightly different from reality .
at the same time , you cannot expect a better picture even in low light .
talking about the front camera , there is also an 8-megapixel selfie camera which is equipped with flash light .
the rear camera &apos;s ult phone &apos;s selfie camera has been excellent .
photos taken with the front camera are bright and sharp and the details of the object are also captured well by this camera .
in the day , while the phone &apos;s selfie camera has given excellent results , in the night or low light , it has clicked a better photo than the average .
the phone &apos;s selfie camera is also equipped with filters with beauty mode and panorama mode .
comio c2 is a real dual sim phone in which two sim cards and one microsd can be used simultaneously .
this phone supports 4g volte and both sims can be used on 4g networks .
at the same time , it has been given features like bluetooth and wifi with microusb port for data transfer . after good specification , the absence of fingerprint sensor in the phone will be called a major drawback .
in comio c2 , the company has taken special care of power backup .
this phone has a large battery of 4,000 mah .
although this phone does not support any fast charging technology , but during the usage of a few days , the phone has not taken much time to be fully charged .
if you talk about battery backup , the company claims that this phone is capable of giving 500 hours of standby time .
battery backup during use has been really great .
with a full charge and continuous use , this phone has been able to easily take out one and a half days .
battery backup of the phone can be said to be good .
while the design and look of the comio c2 looks breathtaking , the display is mediocre .
while this phone is great for selfie lovers , its rear camera will disappoint you a bit .
according to the price , the specifications of the phone are fine and no complaints have been received in c2 even in processing .
also the phone battery is also excellent .
even after everything is good , you will miss the fingerprint sensor .
in this case , it can be said that if the fingerprint scanner does not mean much to you , then you can take this phone .
because it is not only very stylish but also gives the assurance of good performance .
after the success of honor 9i and honor 7x in the mid-range budget , huawei &apos;s all-brand honor has now introduced smartphone view 10 with an edge to age display in its flagship series .
although this phone will be available for sale in india from next month but before that this phone became available to us .
although we have not reviewed the phone yet , you can see the first glimpse .
with this , you can get an idea how the phone will be .
honor view 10 is a smart looking phone .
although it is somewhat reminiscent of honor 8 pro , but it gives you even better grip as it is slightly slim compared to the older model .
the phone is made of full metal body , antenna bands are given on the top and bottom side like the i phone .
the most important thing can be said that despite having a full vision display , its finger print sensor is given below the screen on the front panel .
google pixel 2 review : small display , big performance
however , as usual , its camera is facing out , which is expected to fall scratches .
in the right panel of the phone , you will find the volume and power baton , while the left panel has a sim slot .
there is also a system of microsd card .
on the bottom side of the phone you will find a loudspeaker , type c charger and 3.5 mma audio jack .
at the same time , the upper panel has an infrared port and secondary mic , which is used for voice cancellation .
in honor view 10 , you will get a 5.99-inch fullhd + full vision screen . its larger screen size will be said to be good for those looking for more gaming and videos .
not only this , you can easily see it even in bright sunlight and the touch response of the phone is also very smooth .
in the beginning , the touch feeling was also good .
honor view 10 is offered by the company on its own kirin 970 chipset .
it is a high end chipset that is believed to be on par with the qualco mm snapdragon 835 .
this phone has a 2.4 ghz octa-core processor .
also , it has 6 gb of ram and 128 gb of internal storage .
the phone has dual sim support but the second sim is hybrid where you will be able to use either one of the sim or memory card .
we have just used this phone for a few days .
in such a situation , we cannot talk much about performance at the moment .
know which phone is better in asus zenfone 3 max and samsung galaxy j7 prime ?
as always , in this phone of honor , you have been given an emui which is available on android operating system nugget .
you will find many software features in this phone .
such as motion control , voice control , face recognition and dual apps .
apart from this , a lot will be seen .
almost all of huawei &apos;s phones are known for good photography and hence the company has tried to do something similar in it .
honor view 10 has a 16-megapixel + 20-megapixel dual rear camera .
the phone has a sensor aperture f / 1.8 , which gives the assurance of clicking good photos even in the dark .
camera placement is also in the corner just like the iphone .
its front panel has a 16-megapixel sensor , which offers options like portrait mode and moving picture .
the selfie camera is given next to the earpiece which is capable of taking wide angle photos .
however , it is too early to comment on photo quality at the moment .
honor 7x : an all-rounder phone
at present , the company has not given any information about the price , but it is expected that it can be offered by honor in the same model of 8 pro .
huawei brand honor launched honor 6x in india earlier this year .
it was one of the most successful phones of the company this year .
due to the low price , excellent dual camera and excellent design , it was able to grab people &apos;s attention .
this phone has now been launched in india as well , in ace , one would like to know whether the 7x will be able to repeat the popularity of its old version 6x ? this phone was also available to us for review and complete information about the phone is in front of you .
honor 7x has a metal body and is sleek .
the thickness of the phone is only 7.6  mm .
in the rear panel of the phone , you will see the band design .
the phone has a dual camera and flash on the band at the top .
the camera of the phone is coming up slightly from the back body , so there will always be a risk of scratching it .
although there are mobile ring stands in the market today , if you paste them in the panel , it will be quite safe .
talking about the home panel , you will see only the screen on the entire panel .
there is no hardware or capacitive button here .

last year google launched pixel fons with a lot of noise .
the company introduced pixel and pixel xl .
these phones of google were very popular in terms of camera and software .
at the same time , the company has launched its new version , which has been named pixel 2 and pixel xl2 .
obviously , when a big company like google launches the phone , then there will be noise .
there is a lot of discussion about these phones this year .
we also have google pixel 2 available for review .
the price of this phone in the indian market starts from rs 61,000 .
this phone of google is considered in the premium segment .
in such a situation , the user would like to know whether pixel 2 is the best in this price or whether it would be better to take iphone and galaxy note ?
google pixel 2 is a small device in this trend of today &apos;s big phones .
the built quality of the phone is very good but there is no newness in the design .
this phone is similar to pixel launched last year .
on the other hand , if you are spending more than 60,000 rupees then you will definitely want the design of the phone to be attractive .
in this case too , pixel 2 is behind .
from the front it is very similar to an ordinary phone .
dual pattern has been used at the back which brings little charm .
at the bottom of the back panel you will find a matte finish metal body while the upper body is shiny with flash on the camera .
the company has given speakers below and above the screen on the front panel .
due to this , a lot of free space appears at the bottom of the screen .
yes , the good thing can be said in the design that this small phone comes comfortably in the palm and will not feel too uncomfortable if you keep it in the pocket .
google pixel 2 is ip67 certified , which it believes to be a water and dust blocker .
google pixel 2 has a 5.0-inch screen and the phone &apos;s screen resolution is 1080 x 1920 pixels .
for better view , the company has used an amoled screen which has the protection of corning gorilla glass 5 .
the display of the phone is good and the touch response is excellent .
you can easily see the screen even in harsh sunlight .
although many users were seen complaining about the display , but we could not find anything like this .
yes , there was no such feeling as the amoled screen has a bright display .
at the same time , if the resolution of 2 was used , then it would have been called better .
pixel 2 has been introduced on qualco mm snapdragon 835 chipset and the phone has a 2.35 ghz octa-core processor .
the company has given it the power of 4 gb ram .
with this , this phone is available in 64 gb and 128 gb memory .
although many people can talk about 6 gb and 8 gb ram , but we did not feel any need .
you cannot remove any deficiency in the performance segment .
anything you do in the phone is able to do this easily .
we used 4g sim in it and also did volte calling .
call quality was excellent and connectivity was not found anywhere .
during the experiment , we opened more than 15 apps simultaneously and also more than 10 tabs in the browser .
but the performance remained the same .
software
google phones are more talked about due to their software , less due to hardware .
because these phones work on the latest android and they will also get android update first .
pixel 2 works on the latest operating system 8.0 oreo on android .
this is the first phone that was first introduced on oreo .
at the same time , it will also get updates for the next three years .
that is , you can use up to android r.
the company has introduced a machine learning assistant in it who is able to understand your voice easily .
the phone &apos;s google assistant is amazing and the voice recognition is amazing .
at the same time , like the htc phone , it also has a squeeze option where you can press the phone and use many features .
the vice assistant will open as soon as you press the phone in the palm .
at the same time , by pressing the ring , you can do silent .
this feature was very attractive .
the rear camera of pixel 2 is 12.2-megapixel while the front camera is given 8-megapixel .
f / 1.8 aperture sensor has been provided with the rear camera , which is capable of taking big pictures .
at the same time , with the front camera , you will get an f / 2.4 aperture sensor .
pixel series phones were able to get a score of 94 on doxx last year , while this time the pixel 2 xl went up to a score of 99 , which is said to be ahead of the iphone 8 and note 8 .
at the same time it can be said that you can use portrait mode with both the front and back camera of the phone .
the picture quality of the phone is very good and both the cameras support optical image stabilization and electronic image stabilization feature .
however , you can say that the iphone 8 plus and galaxy note 8 have dual cameras in this segment , so if this phone also had a dual camera , it would have been better .
but if you want a camera to count only dual cameras , then you can say lack .
otherwise its camera is so great that you can call it one of the best phones .
the phone has a portrait mode option with both front and back cameras , which works extremely well .
you can also call google pixel 2 the best camera phone ever .
connectivity features
this phone has single sim support and you can use nano sim .
there will be wifi and bluetooth with 4g volte for data .
it has usb type c.
the rear panel has a fingerprint sensor .
the fingers easily reach the fingerprint sensor .
pixel 2 will get a fingerprint sensor but is not infrared .
google pixel 2 has been introduced with a 2,700 mah battery .
in today &apos;s era of 5,000 mah battery you may find it less but let me tell you that the software optimization is very good and the battery backup of the phone is excellent .
overall , google pixel 2 is great in terms of camera , performance and battery .
at the same time , its smooth software optimization and new operating system will also catch your attention .
but its design stops your hands .
yes , if you want the best camera phone then you can buy it with your eyes closed .

today in the indian smartphone market , almost all companies are trying to introduce such phones which are equipped with the best specifications along with 4g volte at a low price .
the fast growing chinese company xiaomi launched redmi 5a in the indian market yesterday .
on the other hand , today xiaomi &apos;s biggest rival indian smartphone maker micromax has also launched india 5 smartphone in the country .
both these phones have been offered on a low budget , so the users are confused as to which of these two &apos; 5&apos; is the best for them .
next we have tried to know who is the best choice among these two phones .
design &amp; display
xiaomi redmi 5a has been introduced on a polycarbonate plastic body .
this phone has a 5-inch hd display with 1280 × 720 pixels resolution .
the micromax bharat 5 has been introduced on a plastic polycarbonate body .
in this , you will get to see a 5.2-inch hd display with 1280 × 720 pixels resolution , which is protected with 2.5d curved glass .
xiaomi redmi 5a has been introduced in two variants .
redmi 5a can be purchased in two variants of 2 gb ram and 16 gb memory and 3 gb ram and 32 gb memory .
the phone &apos;s storage can be increased to 256 gb .
in micromax bharat 5 , you will get 1 gb ram and 16 gb internal storage .
the phone &apos;s storage can be expanded up to 64 gb via microsd card .
software and processor
the redmi 5a is introduced by xiaomi on the mui 9 based android nugget and the phone runs on qualco mm &apos;s snapdragon 425 chipset with quad-core processor .
micromax bharat 5 has also been introduced on android nugget .
this phone runs on a mediatek mt 6737 chipset with an octa-core processor .
a 13-megapixel rear camera with f / 2.2 aperture with led flash has been provided on the back panel of xiaomi redmi 5a for photography .
there is a 5-megapixel selfie camera on the front panel of the phone .
micromax has given a 5-megapixel rear camera with f / 2.2 aperture with led flash on the back panel of bharat 5 smartphone .
at the same time , a 5-megapixel selfie camera with flash will be seen on the front panel of the phone .
the xiaomi redmi 5a supports 3,000mah battery for power backup .
micromax bharat 5 has a large 5,000 mah battery for power backup .
the variant of 2 gb ram / 16 gb memory of xiaomi redmi 5a has been launched for rs 5,999 and its 3 gb ram / 32 gb memory variant has been launched in the market at a price of rs 6,999 .
it is worth noting that xiaomi is giving a cashback of rs 1,000 on the variant of 2 gb ram / 16 gb memory of redmi 5a , after which this phone is getting rs 4,999 .
talking about the price of micromax bharat 5 , this phone has been launched by the company at a price of rs 5,555 .
micromax bharat 5 with 5,000 mah battery came in the competition of xiaomi redmi 5a
looking at the phone &apos;s processing , xiaomi redmi 5a looks better in terms of ram and processor .
at the same time , the display here defeats micromax &apos;s india 5 xiaomi .
in the photography segment too , micromax bharat 5 is capable of taking a better selfie than xiaomi redmi 5a due to the front flash .
if you talk about the original price without discount , then xiaomi redmi 5a micromax has proved to be expensive compared to bharat 5 .
the biggest difference between the two phones is the 5,000 mah battery , which makes the bharat 5 the &apos; smartphone of india &apos; , surpassing the redmi 5a .
gionee has recently introduced its first bezel-less phone m7 power in india .
the company has high hopes regarding this phone and the users are also very keen to know about the phone .
with the launch , this phone also came to us for review and soon we have appeared before you with the information of this phone .
let &apos;s start the review in the phone with its design .
as it is known , it is a bezelless display phone and has a big 6-inch screen .
despite this you will not feel very big .
it is similar to a phone with 5.5-inch screen that will easily fall into your palm .
the back panel of this phone with a metal frame is patterned which prevents it from sliding from the palm .
there is very little space on the main panel and you will not find any physical buttons .
power and volume buttons are given on the side .
the good thing can be said that despite the large screen , the finger easily comes to the fingerprint sensor .
as far as the look is concerned , we will not call it a very attractive phone .
yes it is good to look at and the build quality also looks great .
here &apos;s a glimpse of the moto x4 : the camera is average after the excellent styling and strong specifications
gionee m7 power has a large 6-inch screen with 1440 × 720 pixels resolution ( hd plus resolution ) with 18 : 9 aspect .
the company has used 2.5d curved glass and it is corning gorilla glass 3 protected .
the screen of the phone is not very bright like the amoled display but is good and you can see clearly even in the sun .
yes , if it had full hd , it would have been called fantastic .
this phone has been introduced with 4 gb ram and 64 gb internal .
the phone has memory card support and you can expand it up to 256 gb via microsd card .
this phone has been introduced on qualco mm snapdragon 435 chipset and the phone has a 1.4 ghz octa-core processor .
there is adreno 505 gpu for better graphics .
this is the section where the company proves to be the weakest .
one can expect at least 600 series chipsets in this range of phones .
although we did not find much difference in the initial use and the phone was working correctly , but it definitely falls a bit behind compared to other phones .
get used to saying &quot; hi bixby &quot; , this service is smart and intelligent
gionee m7 power works on amigo os 5.0 based on android operating system 7.1 nougat .
however , if you have already used a gionee phone , there will be a lot of change in the ui .
in this , the quick setting will come from the top like an ordinary android phone , whereas in the old gionee phone , it was open from the bottom .
however the menu style is the same .
on the home panel you will find apps that you can see by swiping .
apart from this , the company has also given some gesture control which is good .
for photography , this phone has a 13-megapixel f / 2.0 aperture rear camera with led flash .
in this era of dual cameras , it would have been fun if there was a dual sensor .
with the camera in the phone , you will get options like panaroma , facebuti and 3d photo .
3d photos are very similar to samsung live photos .
we found the picture quality of the phone very simple .
the picture quality is good in good light but goes a little far from the actual color .
at the same time there was little pixelation in low light .
yes , selfie will impress you a lot .
it has an 8-megapixel selfie camera with f / 2.2 aperture , but the selfie looks quite good which becomes even more attractive with beautymode .
infinix hot 4 pro review : great processing , pricey battery but little back in design
the company has introduced this phone with a large battery .
in this phone you will get a powerful battery of 5,000 mah .
when fully charged it is able to drain more than two days comfortably .
however , we did not receive the charger with the sales pack so we cannot claim charging time in it .
at the same time , the good thing can be said with the phone that it has reverse charging support and you can charge other phones from your phone .
the second slot in dual sim based gionee m7 power is hybrid and you can use either sim or memory card .
usb otg support will be available in it .
at the same time , its fingerprint sensor works very fast .
in the indian market , the price of gionee m7 power is rs 16,999 and in this price we liked it .
although the processor may disappoint you a bit , but due to the battery , selfie and bezelless display , it proves to be a good option .
in this budget , the phone is expected to get a tough competition from honor 9i and vivo v7 .
after long discussion , lenovo brand motorola finally introduced the moto x4 model in india .
there is a lot of discussion about this phone .
although an android version of the moto x4 is also available on the outside , but a simple android model has arrived in india .
in the indian market , this phone is available for rs 20,999 and rs 22,999 .
this price segment is such that where people want to pay less price but find the phone like iphone and galaxy note series .
in such a situation , the question is whether the moto x4 is premium in terms of design and feature , or a simple android phone made only for moto fan .
although we have currently introduced the first glimpse of the phone here , it is not a complete test .
despite this , this article will be very helpful for you in the choice of better phone .
design and display
if we leave the camera placement of moto x4 , then it is quite different from other moto phones in terms of look and we liked this newness .
the front and back panel of the phone is made of glass and will give you this premium feel .
although the back panel is very much curved like samsung &apos;s galaxy s series phones but the quality is good .
at the same time , it can be said that both the front and back panels of the phone are gorilla glass 3 coated .
in such a situation , scratches will not come quickly and the screen will also be strong .
like other moto phones , it is also a dust and water blocker .
phones like iphone 8 and galaxy note 8 also get the same rating .
overall , we liked this phone in terms of design .
this compact design phone is very attractive to watch and has the power to attract attention at first glance .
you can say that this phone makes you feel premium in terms of design .
the phone has a 5.2-inch full hd screen .
the display of the phone is excellent and one can easily see it even in the harsh sunlight .
the touch response of the phone is very good and is quite smooth as well .
vivo v7 plus review : not only selfie , performance is also better
talking about the hardware of moto x4 , it is good but cannot say very good .
this phone has been given 32 gb memory with 3 gb ram and 64 gb memory with 4 gb ram .
the phone has memory card support and tightens using cards up to 256 gb .
this phone is based on qualco mm snapdragon 630 chipset and has a 2.2 ghz octa-core processor .
with almost the same specifications , the moto g5s plus is available at a much lower price .
this is the reason why we said specification is not good enough .
if the memory in this range was 128 gb , it would have been called fantastic .
this phone runs on android operating system 7.1 nougat .
in this , you will get to see stock android ie pure android .
the user interface is smooth and quite nice too .
moto has also introduced special security feature with this phone where you can use fingerprint to unlock apps .
apart from this , many newness will be seen in the apps .
for photography , the moto x4 has a 12-megapixel + 8-megapixel dual rear camera setup .
one camera is simple while the other is wide angle .
you can use features like portrait mode and hdr .
although we did not find the camera very impressive in the initial result and it was a bit slow but maybe it will get better in a couple of updates .
at the same time , it has a 16-megapixel front camera for selfie .
music
yes , it is necessary to mention music in this phone .
the moto x4 is equipped with bluetooth 5.0 by the company and you can connect it with 4 devices at a time .
this is the first phone in the world which is equipped with such a feature .
at the same time , the phone has stereo mode where if you have equipped with two speakers then both will play with left right music combination .
the moto x4 has dual sim support and you can enjoy 4g volte .
however , the second slot is hybrid where you can use either sim or memory card .
for power backup , the company has given a 3,000 mah battery in it .
can &apos;t say much about it at the moment , but we liked it better in the initial use .
if you have a smartphone , then you would like all its features to be smart .
if you call calling , messaging and internet as smart feature then you are probably wrong .
the smart feature is the one through which you simply order and make the phone do that work .
you say something and that thing is on the screen of your phone .
by now you may be thinking of just the voice command , but it is not so .
i am talking about smart artificial intelligence ( ai ) here .
recently there has been a lot of discussion of ai in smartphones and many services based on this have also been launched .
in such a situation , samsung has also started an artificial intelligence service named &quot; bixby &quot; .
although this service was started by the company in india with the galaxy note 8 , but today it is also available for the galaxy s8 and s8 plus .
with bixby , bixby vice has also arrived in india .
since we also had samsung galaxy note 8 , we also thoroughly tested this service and saw how accurate it is .
apart from this , it also tried to check whether it is beneficial for the user .
samsung &apos;s &quot; bixby &quot; is your personal assistant who is obliged to obey everything you say .
the company wants to offer this service in a big way , which is why the note 8 has a special button for bixby .
however , after coming to bixby vice service in india , it is not necessary that you press that button but only to say &quot; hi bixby &quot; and you will be done .
your personal assistant will be activated and you can make any order .
to activate &quot; bixby &quot; with the voice command , it is necessary that you first enable the voice wakeup in bixby .
otherwise you press and hold the bixby button for some time , then the option of voice command will come .
how to make a vice wakeup in bixby
to enable bixby vice wakeup , you can use the bixby button or swipe from left to right on the home screen and bixby home will come .
at the top right there , you will find a menu option where the setting option will appear .
from there you can enable vice wakeup in bixby .
what can bixby do
after so much , you must be thinking that it is okay to enable bixby but how much work it can do .
so let &apos;s count you one by one what your assistant bixby can do for you .
app in the phone open : when the screen of your phone is off , first you open the screen , then unlock and then open the app , but in bixby , you can give the command directly on the screen .
you can ask to open apps by speaking hi bixby .
you can open all the apps including facebook , whatsapp , camera and calling without touching your phone .
at the same time it can be said that it will not only open the app for you , but will also call , message someone and call you .
like you ” hi bixby , open whatsapp and send message to raj &apos; im in office &apos; , the message will go along with that .
not only this , you will order it and it is capable of setting alarms for you by itself .
message will read : if you are busy with some work and if any message comes , you will just order bixby and he will read the message himself .
apart from this , if you say that to read the message of a particular person available in the contact , then she will also do it .
you can take a screen shot by speaking just two words : where to take a screenshot right now , you have to press the power and volume buttons with enough precaution to take a screenshot .
at the same time , you do not need to touch the phone through bixby , it will take a screenshot with you speaking and then share it at your request .
for you , it will translate text : samsung has introduced bixby vision with its camera .
this makes the camera feature smarter .
you select the bixby vision by turning on the camera and then point out the camera and click on it and see how well it works .
it will search the image and give many information about it .
not only this .
if there is text in it , then you can also translate from there .
the app will install : if you have bixby , then you do not have to take a long process to search or install an app , but you just have to open bixby google play and tell the name of the app and order the install and all your will do the job .
location and parking will tell the address of the car : if you are driving the car , you do not need to set the location in the phone by stopping the car , but will order bixby vice and it will set the location and direction on the map .
at the same time , the most special thing that we found is that if you forgot to park the car where it is , then bixby will tell you where your car is parked and will also reach you .
samsung galaxy j7 max review : is this phone a max performer ?
bix be home : the company first launched bixby home in india .
this can be done by swiping your home screen from left to right , or you can click the bixby button once .
from here you can link other apps including your twitter , facebook and linkedin and it is able to tell about it .
not only this , through your location , you will also give information about good places nearby , restaurants etc .
you can give permission by yourself :
in bixby , the company has provided this feature through which you can set yourself which apps to use through bixby and which do not .
apart from this , bixby &apos;s background can be set to color and language .
how was the experience
samsung galaxy note 8 used bixby vice for a long time and based on this , it can be said that if you enable it , then you can use the phone without any hands .
bixby is quite accurate and catches your accent very quickly and works quite well by understanding it .
yes , a big drawback here can be said that it does not have hindi support but samsung has been available in india for a long time and the company has long data of indian users .
in such a situation , one can also expect hindi support soon .
where is the need to improve
although it is quite accurate , but if the vice is kept on low sensitivity then it becomes a bit annoying and if kept on high sensitivity then it often becomes active with the other vice .
there is us english in it .
in such a situation , when used in indian english , you can never catch the accent quickly and you have to speak again and again .
however , we hope that the company will soon overcome these shortcomings through updates .
on the other hand , if you leave some shortcomings , then the use of this bixby vice is very fun and in the beginning you will keep talking to it for hours .
so make it a habit to say hi bixby .
a few months ago , hong kong &apos;s company infinix launched its two smartphones in india .
one of these together is the low budget wall hot 4 pro while the other was the note 4 model .
during the launch , both phones were in great discussion due to their good specification and price .
in such a situation , we also wanted to know whether they are powerful only in the specification or in performance also you will live up to your expectations .
in such a situation , the infinix hot 4 pro became available to us for review .
although it was a while since the phone was launched , but still there was a lot of curiosity about its review .
the infinix hot 4 pro is priced at rs 7,499 in indian mabar .
regarding this phone launched in the budget segment , it was believed that it is going to give a tough competition to xiaomi and micromax and intex companies and we tried to check the same .
these 5 smartphones will give competition to nokia 2
the infinix hot 4 pro &apos;s body is made of polycarbonate .
although very few phones are being launched nowadays , which you can open the back panel , but you can remove its cover .
however , the battery itself cannot be replaced .
to install or remove a sim card and sd card , you must remove the back cover of the phone .
although in today &apos;s metal design trend this phone of polycarbonate will not attract you much but we liked its built quality .
yes , there is not much innovation in the design of the phone .
it is very similar to an ordinary android phone that comes in this range .
talking about the front panel , no physical button has been given on it and three capacitive buttons are present on the touch panel itself .
the camera and fingerprint sensor are present in the same setup on the back panel of the phone .
the placement of the fingerprint sensor is good , the finger catching the phone easily reaches the sensor .
the power key and volume rocker are given on the right panel of the phone .
these buttons can also be used easily .
overall the design is fine but the drawback can only say that the back panel was scratched during use and the paint was sticky .
the infinix hot 4 pro has a 5.5-inch hd ips screen with 1280 × 720 pixels resolution .
the display of the phone is quite bright and there is no reduction in color and picture sharpness .
this display provides clear visibility in the sun and provides a good viewer experience while watching videos and movies .
at the same time , the screen protection of the phone is not known .
there were fingerprints on the screen during use .
to some extent they bother during video watching and gaming .
xiaomi &apos;s cheapest smartphone redmi y1 launched with 16-mp selfie camera and 4 gb ram
hot 4 pro has 3 gb of ram and 16 gb of internal storage .
the phone &apos;s storage can be increased up to 128 gb via external card .
in order to maintain the phone &apos;s visual quality , the mali-t720mp2 is present in this phone for graphics .
for processing , the phone has a cortex a53 64 bit quad-core processor with 1.3 ghz clock speed which runs on the mediatek mt 6737 chipset .
the specifications of the phone in this range will be called quite good .
although the memory would have been 32 gb and better said .
if you talk about performance , it will not disappoint you there .
there was no decrease in the processing speed of the phone as per the ram and the internet has also worked on the right speed on the 4g network .
during the experiment , we opened several apps on it simultaneously and also several tabs in the browser but there was no difference from anywhere .
it was working well .
in terms of processing , you can call it one of the best phones in this range .
infinix has introduced this phone on xos which is based on android operating system 6.0 marshmallow .
now , where google has rolled out android 8.0 oreo all over the world , the presence of marshmallow in this phone can be said to be a bit lacking .
however , its user interface will make you feel new .
auto wallpaper changes and lock screen will bring new thoughts that further increase the usefulness of this phone .
due to xos , &apos; motivational quotes &apos; automatically come on the lock screen of the phone .
if you are not using an app for some time and do not want to delete it from the phone , then you can put it in the freezer app .
this app puts your chosen app into sleep mode and clears ram .
similarly , with a click of the shuffle given in the phone , changing the phone &apos;s thickness gives it a new look .
world &apos;s first artificial intelligence technology based selfie camera phone launched in india
in the infinix hot 4 pro , the rear camera is given at the center rather than at the edges , which can be called a good setup .
a 13-megapixel auto-focus rear camera is provided on the back panel of the phone , which is equipped with led flash .
while the camera flash brightens the object even in low light , the camera has a separate night mode .
night mode allows more and more light to be captured in the lens in the dark to make the photo clear .
similarly , beauty mode , professional mode and panorama mode are also present in the phone .
digital zoom up to 4.0 x can be used in the phone .
regarding the front camera , it is with the blicul earpiece .
in such a situation , the frame becomes perfect during selfie .
the phone has a 5-megapixel selfie camera with flash .
to take selfies with the group , it has &apos; wideselfie &apos; mode , which provides a larger frame .
it also has beauty mode for beautiful selfies .
both cameras of the phone are capable of taking good pictures in good light .
but there were few pixels in low light .
infinix hot 4 pro is a dual sim phone in which two sim cards can be fitted .
this phone supports 4g volte and works on both sim 4g networks .
for data transfer , it has been given features like bluetooth and wifi along with otg support .
for security , it has a fingerprint sensor on the back panel and along with that there is a screen recording option in the phone .
where the fingerprint sensor does not allow the phone to be unlocked , on the screen recording , any person will do whatever is in your phone , you will be able to see it through video .
after feature phone , jio is now bringing very cheap android smartphone , airtel and vodafone will face tough challenge again
for power backup , the infinix hot 4 pro 4,000 mah battery is provided which supports quick charging .
of course the back cover of this phone is removable but the battery of the phone is inbuilt which cannot be removed .
battery backup is good and once fully charged it is able to take out easily from one to one and a half days .
after looking at all the segments , finally it comes that whether or not this phone should be taken , let me tell you that the price of infinix hot 4 pro is rs 7,499 .
in terms of specifications , this phone fits into this budget .
in terms of processing , it meets the claims of the phone company and the battery backup of the phone does not disappoint even more power backup .
can &apos;t say the camera is good enough .
yes , we were hoping for something a little better in terms of design .
in such a situation , it can be said that if you want a phone with the best performance , which has a good battery backup , then it is right .
but if you are looking for a good looking phone then this is not it .
if we look at the indian mobile market , you will see that the largest crowd is in the segment of rs 12,000 .
there are most buyers in this range and that is why all companies target this segment the most .
however , as far as the mobile consumer is concerned , they show confidence in the phones of most old companies .
in such a situation , it becomes more difficult for new companies to make their way .
new companies entice the mobile user with superior features and attractive pricing .
although many companies come and go in this segment every year , but some get success .
this year too , a similar new company has entered the indian mobile market .
chinese mobile manufacturer tenor has introduced its phones in the rs 12,000 segment where it has a direct competition with older companies like xiaomi and motorola .
the company has introduced two phones but tenor g phone was available for review .
now we had to see whether tenorji would find his identity among the old giants or would he be lost somewhere in this crowd ?
often we start the review with the design but it is necessary to mention the camera here first .
seeing the quality of the camera , it is said that even though tenor is a new smartphone company , it has not compromised on the quality .
the tenor g has a 13-megapixel dual rear camera that clicks extremely great pictures .
it has a sensor rgb and another monochrome .
this sensor captures more light so that you get clear pictures even in low rosini .
whether it is a clicked photo during the day or at night , this phone comes true in every sense .
not only this , its camera has the ability to click photos with perfect bokeh effect .
for the selfie buff , the company has given a 16-megapixel front camera in it .
with the selfie camera you will get flash and it clicks the best pictures even in the dark .
if you will see , at this price , phones like xiaomi and moto get weak in terms of selfies .
tenor g is also not weak in specification in the budget of rs 12,000 .
it has been introduced on qualco mm snapdragon 626 chipset and the phone has a 2.2 ghz octa-core processor .
this chipset is an upgrade from the chipset used in xiaomi and moto phones .
in the phone , you will be able to run heavy graphic games easily .
also , due to 4 gb ram and optimized os , this phone is able to handle your daily tasks easily .
the tenor g android operating system works on 7.1.2 nugget and the good thing can be said that you will not find any layering in it .
it is based on the stock android you call pure android .
the phone does not have much preloaded apps .
in this case , you can download the app yourself according to your need .
apart from this , you will get the ambient display feature , which works like the moto display feature .
the company says that it will soon get the update of the latest os of android .
its battery segment is also not weak .
the company has introduced it with a 4000 mah battery .
this phone is capable of giving a backup of about one and a half days once fully charged .
however , a drawback here will be that the phone does not have fast charging support .
this is the segment where we were looking for something better .
although tenor g has been introduced in full metal design , but we did not like it very much .
it looks like a common android phone .
its design is very similar to the coolpad cool 6 launched this year .
the design lacks newness .
there are no buttons given below the front screen , while the fingerprint sensor is available in the rear panel , which is very responsive .
the tenor g has a 5.5-inch full hd display .
the display of the phone is good and you will be able to use it easily even in strong sunlight .
not only this , because of its fast sound quality , you will also be able to enjoy your videos in it .
tenor g has dual sim support .
the phone has usb 2.0 for charging .
although there is no usb otg support with the phone , the company says that it will get an update in a few days , in which otg support will be available and you can use pendrive or any external device .
after seeing everything , it would come back at the end and stop at the price and you would also like to know if the phone is worth buying or not .
tenor g is available at a price of rs 12,999 .
its design is simple and not bad .
the performance is good and the camera is also better .
at the same time , the battery is also strong .
in such a situation , according to me , this phone is worth shopping .
in any case , xiaomi mi a1 and moto g5s plus are nothing less .
we liked it better .
yes , the only reason for not buying is brand new .
although the craze of selfie has been a shadow for many years , companies like opo and vivo have worked to increase this craze further .
both have introduced more than one phone in the selfie series , which has a powerful selfie camera .
at the same time , vivo has introduced full screen display with selfie in its new device .
the company has launched vivo v7 plus phone in india which is available with 18 : 9 aspect new screen ratio .
this is the first phone from the company that has been introduced with infinity display .
the price of this phone in the indian market is rs 21,990 .
this price will not be called low .
in such a situation , the only question for the common user will be that this phone is so powerful that it can make full recovery of your money or it will remain as an ordinary phone .
this is what we tried to know during our nearly 20 days of usage .
first of all , start with its display and design .
design that display
vivo v7 plus has been introduced in full metal design and the built quality of the phone is very good .
since the bagel is a display , no button will be given below the screen .
all buttons are given on the screen itself .
yes the power and volume buttons are given in the left panel while the sim is given in the left panel .
the fingerprint sensor has been given in the rear panel of the phone itself .
despite the big screen , this phone is slim to watch and will attract you a lot .
its thickness is only 7.7  mm .
in vivo v7 plus , you have a 5.9-inch screen and its screen resolution is 720 c 1440 pixels .
the company has used an ips lcd display panel .
the screen of the phone is gorilla glass 3 coated which protects it from scratch .
although you cannot make up for the lack of simple display , but when you use a game with high definition graphics , there will be a slight feeling .
good thing can be said that despite the large display , this phone is small due to the infinity design and will easily come in your palm or you can walk in a pocket .
despite the good design and better display , it will be said a little behind in terms of pixel density .
because this range , most phones are available with full hd display today .
cult beyond review : attractive design at low cost but slightly slower processing
memory and processor
the vivo v7 plus has been introduced on the qualco mm snapdragon 450 chipset and is the first phone in the world to be available with this chipset .
the phone has a 1.8 ghz octa-core processor .
along with this , 4 gb ram and 64 gb memory has been given .
the phone has memory card support and you have been supported with cards up to 256 gb .
if you look at the specification , you will not complain about ram and rom , but you can speak about the processor that in this budget you can expect snapdragon 600 chipset .
the 400 series chipsets are available at a budget of rs 10,000 .
however , if you get a chance to shop using the phone , you will not say so because we did not get any complaint from anywhere in the performance .
heavy games were played during the experiment and opened several apps simultaneously but no lag was found .
the phone was working smoothly .
at the same time , we liked that this phone was never getting hot during the experiment .
the thing is that we used the fingerprint sensor of the phone many times and it never failed .
it works quite fast and is highly accurate .
nubia n2 : camera and processor disappoint after strong battery and superb display
like other phones of recently launched vivo , you will get a strong selfie camera in the v7 plus .
the phone has a 24-mp selfie camera .
along with this , a 16-megapixel rear camera with f / 2.0 aperture will be available .
there is no doubt that its selfie camera is very good and you can call it one of the best selfie phones .
with the selfie camera , you will get features like autofocus and hdr mode .
at the same time , with the selfie camera , the company will get options like face beauty and group selfie .
the selfie camera has a flash and you can take good pictures even in low light .
the company has introduced it with a depth sensor and you can take a picture with a blur background .
talking about the rear camera , it takes a better picture in good light conditions , but in low light or at night , you will get some views in the photo .
the phone has pdaf support and it focuses very fast .
it supports fullhd video record from both front and back cameras and is even better .
look at the android phones launched in india in the last few months , many phones have been launched with stock android .
these include many chinese mobile manufacturers but the vivo v7 plus has been introduced on the funtouch os 3.2 which is based on the android operating system 7.1 .
this os is heavily influenced by ios .
on the home panel , you will see the apps and the quick setting will come from swiping from the bottom to the top .
the phone has some good tweaks which are very useful .
long screen shot and screen recording are one of them .
vivo v7 plus has dual sim support .
at the same time , it can be said that microsd card is given separately in it .
apart from this , fingerprint sensor will also be available .
there is usb otg support with the phone and you can use pendrive or any external device .
in this phone , the company has given 3,225 mah battery .
today there are phones with 4,000 and 5,000 mah batteries in a budget of less than this .
in this case , it can be said a little less but in case of battery backup it is not weak .
despite the large screen , due to better software optimization , this phone is capable of taking out a day comfortably .
the price of vivo v7 plus is rs 21,990 .
there is no such phone with a selfie camera in this budget .
at the same time , full body display also increases its usefulness .
there is no doubt that phones with better specifications are available in this budget , but the more you use vivo v7 plus , the better it will look .
in such a situation , if you prefer to buy the phone from offline store , then v7 plus will be called better device .
after the bad memories from the samsung galaxy note 7 , it was a great effort of the company that the new note should be such that people would forget all the old memories .
at the same time , mobile users were eagerly waiting for this effort of the company .
finally , this much awaited note has been launched last month .
be it us or india , the company has introduced the note this time with big noise and tam jham .
we were also as eager to know about this phone as the common mobile consumer .
and as soon as this phone came to us , we started our investigation .
everything you got to know about this phone during the last 10 days of usage is in front of you .
how is this phone , how is the performance , is the camera better or not and finally is it worth buying or not ? we have tried to answer all these questions in this test .
although there is a lot to talk about in this phone , but start from the design itself .
a few months ago , samsung introduced the galaxy s8 and s8 plus .
these phones with infinity display had a lot of buzz .
the new samsung galaxy note 8 is also in the same design series and can say that it is better than ever .
there is very little space at the top and bottom due to the full body display with curved screen .
at the same time , the edges are more curves and for this reason they look much better in catching .
if you look at the premium segment of samsung in the last few years , you will see that the company has been using glass panels and you will find the same in this phone .
both the front and back panels are made of glass .
the good thing can be said that despite the glass panel does not slip much and can hold it in the hands for a long time comfortably .
the design of this device with a large 6.3-inch screen makes samsung appreciate that the design is such that it gets easily in the palm .
yes , it definitely takes a little longer .
the width of the phone is 74.8  mm while the length is 162.5-inches i.e. more than half a foot long .
this makes it difficult for people with a slightly longer palm to use the entire screen with one hand .
the biggest problem is with the fingerprint scanner .
due to the infinity display , the company has given it a lot in the previous panel and most of the time the finger does not even reach there .
the samsung galaxy note 8 is ip68 certified .
we washed it in water several times and did photography in the rain where this phone was working properly .
moto g5s vs xiaomi mi a1 , know who is better dual camera phone
the galaxy note 8 features a 6.3-inch quadhd super amoled display .
the phone &apos;s screen resolution is 1440 x 2960 pixels and its aspect ratio is 6 : 9 : 3 .
as we have already seen that the display of samsung phone is very bright and best , in such a case , you cannot remove any kind of deficiency in the phone .
it is not possible to move the finger everywhere in the big screen but due to shortcuts on the edge screen , it becomes quite easy .
its touch feeling is much better and always on display further enhances its usefulness .
the screen of the phone is corning gorilla glass 5 coated , which protects it from scratches .
aspen
the samsung galaxy note series is particularly known for its s pen .
however , this time we got to see tiptop with tiptop .
we were thinking that perhaps the point would come out of it like an ordinary pen , but it is not just for drawing the pen .
the screen of note 8 has 4,000 pressur sensitive point support , so the screen expectation changes according to pressure .
the pen is so precise that at the time of its use you will not realize that you are running aspen , not a pen with ink .
in this , both the plane and ruling pages will be available with you .
with the galaxy note 8 , the company can also make notes in the off screen .
as soon as you remove the pen in the screen lock , the note feature will be activated and you can make a note there .
not only this , it is also saved from the off screen that you can open anytime .
as soon as you take out the pen on any screen , the note wheel will be activated on the front screen and you can use the note feature .
you can translate any word and paragraph in the browser only with the air command of the pen , which is very special .
we have already seen this feature in the note phone .
the note 8 has handwriting recognition support and is extremely accurate .
however we found the funniest live message where you can make attractive gif fine by yourself and share it with anyone .
overall , the note feature will make you feel great .
the samsung galaxy note 8 has been introduced in two chipset models .
the company has introduced qualco mm and exynos chipsets .
in india , samsung is a phone with exynos chipset .
the phone has an 8895 exynos 9 10 nm octa-core processor .
the phone has two quadcore processors , one is given the 2.3 ghz octa-core processor while the other processor is 1.7 ghz .
with this , the phone has 6 gb ram memory and 64 gb internal memory .
it has memory card support and you can use cards up to 256 gb .
there is no doubt that it is currently one of the fastest phones in terms of performance .
if you open any number of apps simultaneously , there will be no difference in the performance .
nearly two years later , a samsung note phone has arrived in india .
in this case , in the case of software , you will see something quite new .
this phone runs on android operating system 7.1 nougat .
due to the note feature and bixbay , you have used some new layers .
in the new note , the company has made considerable use of gestures .
you can open the menu plate by swiping from the bottom up or you can swipe it down from the top .
at the same time there is also a shotcut where you can put contact shortcuts in addition to app shortcuts .
its full screen is editable , you can set any app anywhere according to your need .
for note , you have been given microsoft apps in addition to samsung note in it .
in addition to the google apps in the phone , apps such as samsung app store , samsung health and members will appear .
at the same time , the feeling of split screen was also better .
you can run two apps side by side in the phone .
although this feature was also available in the old note phones .
this phone has samsung assistant bixbe and also supports vice .
the bixbay button is given below the power button in the right panel of the phone .
its bixbay vice is also supported and it works quite accurately .
the samsung galaxy note 8 is the first phone from the company to be introduced with a dual camera .
this phone has a 12-megapixel dual camera .
one camera camera is with f / 1.7 aperture while the other is in telephoto lens which has been introduced with f / 2.4 aperture .
this phone is capable of taking closeup macro short with white angle .
along with this , slomotion video will also be available .
yes , we felt a little more color and because of this we felt a little bit far from reality .
an 8-megapixel rear camera has been given for the selfie .
the selfie camera is also fantastic .
the best thing that can be said is that with both rear and selfie cameras , you will get optical image stabilization feature .
at the same time , bixbay vision antigrated which will act as a camera assistant and occupational reality for you .
the feature you would think of for screen lock and security is all present in it .
the phone will also get simple password and pattern lock ranging from fingerprint sensor , facial recognition and iris scanner .
this segment is where i had some trouble .
since we have already mentioned that the phone is quite large and the fingerprint is on the top .
in such a situation , it becomes difficult for people with ordinary palm to carry the fingerprint scanner .
although the fingerprint sensor is very fast and accurate .
you can use the irish scanner but during use it gets cheated many times and then the phone has to be unlocked with the pattern-password .
face unlock also works extremely fast but gets tricked in the dark .
in total , we had to experiment repeatedly during our ten days of experimentation and finally integrated the fingerprint and face unlock together .
for data and connectivity , the samsung galaxy note 8 will also have 4g volte , wifi , bluetooth and usb type-c .
it is difficult to say exactly how it works , but there are plenty of features with it .
the galaxy note 8 has a dex feature through which you can connect your phone to a dex station and use the phone as a desktop .
the samsung galaxy note 8 has a 3,000 mah battery for power backup .
but despite all types of battery optimization , it does not take a full day off .
the samsung galaxy note 8 is priced at rs 67,900 in the indian market and has a cash back of rs 4,000 with an hdfc card .
at the same time , the company is giving a one-year screen replacement warranty and a lot of data is being provided with the jio network .
the most important question is whether this phone should be taken or not .
so let me tell you that for rs 67,900 this phone may seem a bit expensive but once you start using it then everything will be forgotten .
the performance is amazing and no one can match the note feature .
since the iphone 8 has also been launched and the budget is almost the same , then everyone would like to know if the iphone 8 or note 8 is better than the samsung galaxy note 8 according to me .
most phones in india are sold under rs 10,000 and the budget of rs 7,000 is very competitive .
although phones are also quite in this budget , but there are few phones which have been successful in leaving their mark , including xiaomi redmi 4a and redmi 4 , besides moto c plus etc .
in this segment , now another smartphone company cult has launched the beyond model .
the price of this phone is rs 6,999 and it is only available on e-commerce site amazon india .
the company has claimed cult beyond to be a great device .
this phone was also available to us for review and we also tested it .
during this time , it tried to test whether this phone is capable of meeting the expectations of the users or will the company claim to be just a claim ? so let &apos;s take a look at all the segments of this phone :
cult beyond has been introduced on the mattel unibody design .
due to the curved edge and mantle back cover , it will make it feel good .
however , there will be no special newness in the design because we have seen such phones before .
at the same time , due to the camera , flash and sensor on the screen , there is a lot of free space and because of this , the screen size seems a bit large .
there is a fingerprint sensor on the back panel of the phone .
the placement of the fingerprint sensor has been improved .
when you use it , the finger easily reaches there .
the physical &apos; key &apos; on the right panel of the phone makes it easy to access the volume rocker and use the unlock sensor .
the speaker is given at the bottom on the rear panel itself .
the selfie camera on the front panel is given in the center of the phone , which has proved to be helpful in creating a great photo frame .
we had a black model which looked very attractive .
the cult beyond uses a 5.2-inch hd ips 2.5d curved glass display with 1280 × 720 pixels resolution .
although the company has not given information about screen protection .
however , the screen is not scratched during about 10 days of usage .
due to the bright color and sharp brightness display of the phone , it provides clear visibility even in sunlight and gives a good viewer experience while watching videos and movies .
cult beyond has been introduced on the mediatek mt6737 chipset and has a 64 bit quadcore processor with 1.25 ghz class speed .
along with this , it has mali-t720 gpu for better graphics .
along with this , 32 gb of internal storage is provided with 3 gb of ram in the phone and you can also use microsd card up to 32 gb .
in terms of price , the specifications of cult bond will be said to be very good and due to good hardware , we were also expecting better performance .
but it is a bit slow .
although we found that about 1 gb of ram was free in normal use , it was still working slowly .
at the same time , we had problems while browsing on the 4g network .
the phone has been introduced on the android operating system 7.0 nougat .
although oreo has arrived , but is not available in any phone yet .
in such a situation , the os cannot be called old .
the company has kept it similar to stock android , you will not get much layering .
clean and android .
i will definitely get some tweaks .
like - smart wake .
in this lock screen , you can open any app directly by twisting your finger in the shape of english alphabet .
some apps and games are preloaded in the phone .
however there are no full games and you have to download them to play full .
cult beyond &apos;s main usp also includes its photography segment .
the camera setup is similar to the moto g5 .
camera inside the embossed round ring .
however , the placement of flash is different .
white led dual led flash can be seen on the camera .
however there is a fear of scratches in such placements .
it has a 13-megapixel rear camera which supports features such as auto focus and anti shake .
while the camera flash brightens the object even in low light , the beauty feature provided with the camera makes you clean the photos of friends with the help of filters .
yes , where sharpness was not seen in the wide shot taken from the rear camera , the phone &apos;s x 2.0 zoom has also disappointed .
talking about selfie camera , the 13-megapixel selfie camera has also been given on the front panel of this phone .
the beauty feature of the camera also works with the selfie camera , which was found to be average even when taking a selfie .
the front flash light of the phone brightens the object to some extent , but the selfie was not seen as sharp and clear .
however , the selfie camera on the front panel is given in the center of the phone , which proved to be helpful in making a great photo frame .
cult beyond is a rear dual sim phone in which two sim cards and one microsd card can be put together .
this phone supports 4g volte .
fingerprint sensor is provided on the back panel of the phone .
a 3,000 mah battery is provided for power backup .
the phone &apos;s battery is removable , which is rarely seen in smartphones today .
talking about its battery backup , it is difficult to run this phone for a full day , so you will have to keep it with the charger or the power bank .
cult beyond has been launched at a price of rs 6,999 .
along with xiaomi redmi 4 and redmi 4a , intex and micromax smartphones are also available at this price .
cult beyond looks very attractive and strong in terms of specification is very good but remains a bit behind in performance .
while the display of the phone was better , the photography has been a little dull .
last week , lenovo brand motorola launched the moto g5s plus smartphone in the indian market .
yesterday , xiaomi , called chinese apple , introduced its new model mi a1 .
with this launch , the two companies have come face to face once again .
already , the moto g series has been competing with the redmi note series , while today this fight is about dual camera phones .
xiaomi mi a1 and moto g5s plus are almost identical in terms of price .
in such a situation , the big question for the common user is , which phone is better in both ? so let &apos;s get rid of this problem and tell you who can be called good in terms of specification .
android smartphone with 9 best dual rear cameras in a budget of rs 15,000
1 . design
let &apos;s start with design .
the moto g5s plus is good to look at , but there is no innovation in the design .
it is very similar to its old moto g5 series phones .
the body of the moto g5s plus is made of metal and has a slight curve at the back .
for this reason it feels comfortable to hold .
the phone has a nano coating that protects it from water to some extent .
at the same time , the design of xiaomi mi a1 is different from all the phones of the company .
it is sleek and quite smart too .
it is also in full metal unibody design and the build quality is good .
in the back panel you will see a band design like the iphone .
overall , you will like the phone in terms of texture .
due to the new look , it proves to be better than the g5s plus but it does not have a nano coating and in such a situation , moto &apos;s phone outshines xiaomi .
2 . display
the moto g5s plus has a 5.5-inch screen and its screen resolution is full hd 1080 × 1920 pixels .
the screen of the phone is gorilla glass 3 coated which protects it from minor scratches .

you will also get a 5.5-inch full hd display with 1080 × 1920 pixel resolution in xiaomi mi a1 .
at the same time , to protect the screen from scratches and scratches , it has been protected with corning gorilla glass .
although the version of the company gorilla glass is not mentioned .
despite this , its display is great and you will not get any complaints .
3 . processor
the moto g5s plus has been introduced on the qualco mm snapdragon 625 chipset .
in the phone , you will get a 2.0 ghz octa-core processor .
along with this is the adreno 505 gpu .
in the mid range , this processor is known for better performance .
me a1 has also been introduced on qualco mm snapdragon 625 chipset .
the phone has a 2.0 ghz octa-core processor .
at the same time , adreno 506 gpu is also available for graphics .
in this case the two are almost identical .

the phone memory can be increased to 256 gb .
the xiaomi mi a1 is also available with similar specifications .
there is 64 gb memory with 4 gb ram which is expandable up to 256 gb .
5 . camera
in the moto g5s plus , you are given two 13 + 13-megapixel rear cameras .
there is an f / 2.0 aperture sensor with the camera .
the company claims that it is available with a bokeh effect where you can blur the backgrand and its depth of field is also great .
along with this , an 8-megapixel wide angle secondary camera has been given .
the camera of xiaomi mi a1 is also very much discussed .
in this phone you have 12 + 12-megapixel wide angle dual camera .
it has a simple camera while the other lens is a telephoto .
the company has claimed better photography .
it will also get better depth of field with bokeh effect .
at the same time , this phone also has a 5-megapixel front camera for selfie .
although moto is ahead in megapixels , the selfie camera is also better than moto but the camera feature you will get more in mi a1 .
in such a situation , xiaomi goes ahead with just a few points from the moto .
6 . software
the moto g5s plus has been introduced on the android operating system 7.0 nougat and will get further updates .
this will make you feel pure android .
this is the first time xiaomi has launched the phone on stock android except for miui .
me a1 is introduced with android integration .
that is , this phone is ready for android oreo and it will get an update of every latest version of android for two years .
in this case , even in terms of software , it appears ahead of the g5s plus .
7 . battery
the moto g5s plus has a 3,000 mah battery .
whereas in xiaomi mi a1 , you will get 3,080 mah battery .
the company did not mention fast charging .
this is nokia &apos;s trust , all nokia phones will get the latest android oreo update
8 . connectivity

9 . price
the moto g5s plus is priced at rs 15,999 and is available for sale on amazon india .
at the same time , xiaomi mi a1 can be taken for rs 14,999 and this phone can be taken from september 12 from flipkart and mi india store .
10 conclusions
overall , both phones are excellent in specification and not less than each other , but taking dual cameras into consideration , xiaomi will be said to be much better .
at the same time , google is also ahead in software due to android integration .
in such a situation , my opinion goes to xiaomi mi a1 .
gramophone , cassette tape or small mp3 player .
whatever may be the means , but one thing is certain that music has been crazed in every phase .
people love listening and listening to music .
although today music players have changed a lot and have become very advanced .
now the market is decorated with bluetooth enabled smart speakers instead of cassettes and cds .
the special thing can be said that today these music players are available in every budget .
recently pebble has launched a bluetooth speaker in the lower range , which is very stylish to watch .
the speaker , named pebble strom , is priced at rs 1,899 and is also available to us for testing .
now you want to know whether to buy it or not ! so let &apos;s say .
whether you take a low range device or the first of the high range , its look pulls you .
pebble can be said to be very special in terms of strom look .
available in cylinder design , this bluetooth speaker is quite stylish .
seeing its look , you will definitely want to take it in once .
at the same time , we also found the built quality quite good .
it is coffee solid .
though it is big and will not come right in one hand but will make you feel good on touching .
in the indian market , this speaker is available with black with blue combination and black with red combination .
both models will attract you .
yes , it can be said that it has been given a belt to hang . its quality is absolutely average and it often goes away .
in such a situation , it is important to be cautious if you move it by hanging .
had the belt been better with good design , it would have been more fun .
at the same time , the size of the device is large , so you will have to make special arrangements to get it from anywhere .
know why coolpad cool play 6 is a better choice than xiaomi redmi note 4
feature
pebble strom is equipped with bluetooth connectivity 4.0 .
along with this , the device has aux cable support , microsd card support and usb pen drive support .
you can connect it by any means .
there is one speaker each on both sides of the device .
one is for speaker base while the other is for treble and it is equipped with rechargeable battery .
the company claims that pebble strom is capable of supporting bluetooth connectivity up to 25 meters .
although the company has not stated the battery power , but has said to give a battery backup of up to 5-6 hours .
in addition to the power button , volume controller , previous and forward buttons in the device , you will also find a menu and play / stop button .
in addition there is an led light .
on the purchase of any device , you put the final seal only when its performance is better .
in this case pebble strom will not disappoint you .
the music quality of the device is very good and also very fast .
if the song is playing in full sound in the room , then you can easily hear it within a hundred meter radius .
at the same time , coffee is also better for outdoors .
by keeping one place , you can enjoy its music in a large area .
but keep in mind that only good quality music should be played .
if the music is downloaded at a lower bitrate , then the sound will start bursting in a slightly louder sound .
on the other hand , if you have played it on a slow voice and the device is very close to you , then you will not enjoy it because the voice comes from two sides .
therefore , while listening to music , keep a distance of at least 3-4 meters .
regarding battery backup , it will not disappoint you .
once fully charged it is able to drain 5-6 hours comfortably .
overall , the pebble strom is a better device .
the features are good in terms of price and the design is also unique .
but it is less for listening to personal music and better for party and picnic .
if you are a disco fan , then you have the perfect device for a low price .
coolpad has introduced the cool play 6 smartphone in the indian market .
it is currently the cheapest 6 gb ram phone .

in such a situation , consumers will definitely want to know which phone is better for them .

nubia has recently introduced the n2 model .
the price of this phone in india is rs 15,999 .
like other smartphones of the company , it can also be purchased exclusively from online shopping site amazon india .
while this nubia phone has been given a more beautiful look , the company has claimed strong specification .
this phone was also available for review from us and we also wanted to test the performance and quality of the phone .
during this time i used this phone for about a month .
during the experiment , we tried to know , whether the nubia n2 company meets the claims of the company according to the price or disappoints the consumers ?
we started the nubia n2 review with the design and not the battery .
the phone has been launched with a powerful battery of 5,000 mah .
earlier , the company had given a large battery in the n1 model .
an attempt has been made to repeat the same link once again with the n2 model .
the battery backup of the phone is very good .
once fully charged , it ejects comfortably for two days .
during the experiment , we ran the internet for a long time , listen to songs and play games .
the nubia n2 is equipped with a usb type-c port and the phone has fast charging support .
nubia n2 also has a power saver mode to reduce battery consumption .
while using it , we found that even if there is less than 20 percent battery , leaving the phone on the night at night , only 2 percent of the power is easily removed throughout the night .
in this budget , you can call the n2 the best battery backup phone .
at the same time , we never received a complaint of phone heating during charging .
fast charger has been provided with sales pack but the phone does not have fast charging support .
after the battery , the design of the phone will also attract you .
the body of this phone is made of thin metal aluminum with a slight curved corner .
the texture of the front glass panel and metallic back panel of the phone makes the user feel premium .
the placement of the power button and volume rocker in the nubia n2 is done in a very smart manner .
these are given below on the side panel .
even people with small palm can use the button easily .
red circle has been given on the phone &apos;s camera sensor and home button , which makes its look more interactive .
despite everything being good , the drawback can be said that it is slightly wider and you cannot use the edge to age screen with one hand .
not only for small palm people , but big palm also may have some problem .
the nubia n2 features a 5.5-inch amoled hd display with 1280 × 720 pixels resolution .
the company has used the display with incel technology to make the phone slim and light .
this phone of nubia gives clear images by enhancing brightness during video as well as photo and gaming .
it has an auto brightness feature which adjusts the screen automatically according to the fast and low light .
yes , if you want to read something in the dark of night , then the display light will not make your eyes long .
although the display of the phone is good but in the specification it can be said to be quite weak .
because phones with full hd screen are available even in the budget of less than rs 10,000 , but nubia n2 only has hd display .
although amolade technology makes up for it , but still a little behind .
the touchscreen response of the phone is very soft and smooth .
full information of asus zenfone 4 leaked before launch , know how this phone will be
the nubia n2 is introduced on the mediatek mt 6750 chipset and the phone has a 1.5 ghz octa-core processor .
along with this , the mali-t860 gpu has been given .
the phone is far behind in terms of processor .
because in this range xiaomi redmi 4 and moto g5 plus have powerful processors available from it .
the n2 has been provided with 4 gb of ram and has 64 gb of internal storage .
it has expandable memory support and you can use cards up to 128 gb .
during the use of the phone , we opened several tabs in it , played many games and it was able to function properly .
however , in terms of performance , we cannot say that the best is the best .
whenever we get some lag .
this phone works on ui 4.0 operating system which is based on android operating system 6.0 marshmallow .
in this ui you will get some features of nugget as well .
the phone has a split-screen and smart cover feature .
through the split screen , you can run two different apps simultaneously .
although there is not much to tell in the software .
on the home panel , you will find apps which you can see by swiping .
although swipe gestures and age gestures make it different from other android phones and will be fun to use initially , but you cannot use them on a daily basis .
10 powerful phones in the budget of rs 10,000 , which have 4 gb ram memory
for photography , the 13-megapixel rear camera with f / 2.2 aperture with flash has been provided on the back panel of nubia n2 which supports features like pdaf , auto focus .
if you are fond of capturing an ordinary object with creativity , then nubia n2 &apos;s modes like slow shutter , trajectory , slomotion and pro camera can be useful for you .
the phone &apos;s 16-megapixel front camera with f / 2.0 aperture takes decent selfies .
you cannot call it very good .
not only this , if you put filters without photos on facebook and instagram , then you may have problems .
because the picture quality taken from the rear camera of the phone was not very special to us .
pictures taken in low light were very pixelated .
even if you used flash .
dual sim based nubia n2 has two nano sim support .
it has 4g volte support and you will also get other connectivity options but there is no nfc .
the fingerprint sensor has been given on the home button itself , which is capable of unlocking the screen much faster .
after examining and using all the segments of the phone , we found that the main usp of the phone is its battery , which is able to fully meet your expectations .
at the same time , you will also like its look and style .
in photography , both front or rear cameras yielded mediocre results , while looking at the price , we were hoping for better .
processing is fast on average and its interface is also user friendly .
the price of this phone in the indian market is rs 15,999 .
nubia n2 can be called a good option in this budget , but not the best .
because it will get a tough competition from xiaomi redmi note 4 and moto g5 plus .
today , if you look at the offline market , in the segment of rs 15,000 to rs 20,000 , you will get to see some of the phones of oppo and vivo .
but in this price segment , samsung has given new life by launching the galaxy 7 max and galaxy j7 prime .
many options are now available to consumers .
we also came to the samsung galaxy j7 max review and during that time we tried to know whether this samsung phone is capable of leaving behind the phones of brands like oppo and vivo .
however , this time we have not used more words to say our words , but have tried to give accurate information in less words .
the body of the samsung j7 max is made of full metal and feels slightly wider , although you will love it due to its large display and slim design .
as far as newness in the look is concerned , we did not get it .
this phone looks similar to the old samsung phone .
there is a firangerprint sensor on the home button itself which is quite responsive .
at the same time , the light in its capacitive &apos; key &apos; does not burn , due to which you may have some discomfort in the dark .
although the good thing can be said that it has a smart glow light which will give you information about notifications .
the samsung j7 max has a 2.5d curved screen with a 5.7-inch 1080 x 1920 pixel resolution .
due to the big screen , you will be able to enjoy videos and games in it .
also , due to good brightness , you will be able to use it easily in strong sunlight .
for photography , samsung has given a 13-megapixel f / 1.7 aperture rear camera in the galaxy j7 max and a 13-megapixel f / 1.9 front camera .
this phone will give you good picture quality during the day , as well as will not disappoint you even in low light .
especially its front camera with led flash light .
it is capable of giving you good picture quality in every condition .
you can see the camera samples of samsung galaxy j7 max here .
the company has added some new features to its camera interface .
like - ar filters and social shares .
using these features , you can upload photos and videos directly to social networking sites with just one click .
the samsung galaxy j7 max has been introduced on the mediatek mtk 6757 chipset and has a 1.6 ghz octa-core processor .
the phone has 32 gb memory with 4 gb of ram , which can be enlarged through memory card .
although qualco mm processors are more popular in this budget , but you can not underestimate this .
we played an asphalt extreme game in it and we had no problem .
the galaxy j7 max has a touch wiz ui based on android operating system nugget .
this time the company has made the software quite smooth and has also equipped with many new features as well .
such as samsung pay mini , &apos; s &apos; secure , multi-window , face recognition and dual account .
the best thing that can be said is that the samsung galaxy j7 max is a real dual sim phone .
in this , you can use a memory card with two sims .
along with all these good things there is one more good thing in it and that is its 3.300 mah battery .
once fully charged it is able to last a full day .
the samsung galaxy j7 max is priced at rs 17,990 and is available at the offline store .
seeing the specifications and features of the phone , it can be called a good phone .
the galaxy j7 sales pack will be equipped with earphones , power adapter , micro usb cable and sim ejector tool .
last year , vivo launched the selfie centric phone v5 in the indian market .
due to the excellent specification and excellent selfie , consumers appreciated it a lot .
after this , the company also introduced many more models in the same series such as vivo v5 plus and v5s .
the v5s is the latest among them and this phone was also available to us for review .
like other phones of the v5 series , it has also been introduced with the powerful selfie camera .
the price of vivo v5s in the indian market is rs 18,990 .
in this case , we tried to know whether this phone is really the best selfie phone ? at the same time , apart from selfies , are other specifications so better that it can compete with brands like opo and gionee ?
let us start with the design of the review .
vivo v5s is very similar to its older models v5 and v5 plus in terms of design .
although said , it has become a little better than before .
its body made of metal makes you feel premium and the build is very good .
in the last panel itself , you will see an antenna band like the iphone .
the fingerprint sensor will be found on the home button in the v5s .
the fingerprint sensor of the phone is fast and works well .
at the same time , the size of the phone is not very big , in such a way , you can use it comfortably with one hand .
the corners of the phone are slightly curved , so it is hard not to get caught .
yes , it is very smooth , there is a fear of falling , but a phone pack is available with the sales pack .
yes , the complaint is not from the phone but from the cover .
this cover is able to prevent the phone from breaking when it falls and does not even slip by hand but you cannot call it very attractive .
this only serves to spoil the phone &apos;s attractive look .
we have no complaints with the design of the vivo v5s .
this phone has a 5.5-inch hd screen .
the screen resolution of the phone is 720 × 1280 pixels .
the company has used 2.5d curved ips display in it , while corning gorilla glass is coated .
the phone display is good and touch response is also better .
you can easily use this phone even in bright sunlight .
at the same time , it has a blue light mode for use at night and it is really quite beneficial .
this makes the eyes very relaxed .
although it can be said as a drawback , at this price you expect full hd display but we have no complaints with the display .
after a good look , vivo v5s cannot be underestimated even in the specification .
the phone has been introduced on the mediatek mt 6750 chipset and has a 1.5 ghz a53 octa-core processor .
along with this , 4 gb ram memory and 64 gb internal memory has been given .
but keep in mind that its second slot is hybrid where only one of the sim and memory cards can be used .
during usage , the phone was able to use up to 2.5 gb of ram for most of the time .
at the same time , in memory , you get about 50 gb free .
as far as the performance of the phone is concerned , we did not find any deficiency in you from anywhere .
this phone was able to perform almost all its functions well .
during the use of the phone , we opened many apps simultaneously , while browsing , we opened several tabs simultaneously , but no problem was found from anywhere .
although our trial did not stop here , we also downloaded heavy games like plant versus zombie and asphalt extreme and were able to handle it all correctly .
as we talked about in the beginning , the company has introduced it exclusively as a selfie phone .
it has a selfie camera equipped with a sony imx 378 sensor with a 20-megapixel f / 2.0 aperture .
there is also a front flash in the camera , which the company has named moonlight glow .
the quality of the picture taken from the 20-megapixel camera in the phone was good .
however , the photos were getting pixelated in low light .
front flash is helpful to some extent but does not prove to be very useful .
you will have problems in low light .
it also has beauty mode 6.0 app for better selfie and it is really useful .
in this budget , vivo v5s can be called one of the best selfie phones .
the rear camera of the phone is 13-megapixels .
the rear camera of the phone is also good and it focuses very fast .
yes in some photos we felt like it is different from the actual color .
at the same time , a few noises were also visible as the light conditions changed .
in such a situation hdr mode is very useful .
in a word , if we talk about the rear camera of the phone , it is good that it is not very good .
yes it is capable of recording good videos .
the company has mentioned the camera and music in vivo &apos;s slogan .
in such a situation , talking about music is also made here .
the company claims that the phone has been equipped with an ak 4375 audio deck which is capable of giving better sound quality .
there is no doubt that you will get good sound quality on both loudspeaker and earphones but you cannot say it the best .
the vivo v5s has been introduced with the funtouch os 3.0 which is based on the android operating system 6.0 marshmallow .
however , it has been a long time since android operating system 7.0 was launched .
in such a situation , marshmello would be called old .
at the same time , you will also not get google assistant feature .
there are many things you will find different in funtouch os .
while in simple android phones , the quick settings are opened by swiping from the top , while in this you will have to float from the bottom to the top .
the ui of funtouch is not only similar in appearance to apple ios , but the company has also made it very similar in use .
yes , it is necessary to mention the clone app .
in this , you can create a glon of any app and can run two whatsapp , two wechat and two viber accounts in the same phone without login from two accounts .
apart from this , you will also like the split screen and the feature where you can run two apps simultaneously .
however , this cannot be done with all apps at the moment .
it supports only a few apps .
overall , you will get some new features in the os but we like stock android more .
in this dual sim based phone , you can use 4g volte in both slots .
however , data can be run on one sim at a time .
we made a volte call during the experiment and it was working properly .
like the xiaomi phone , it does not have ir blaster and nfc .
the vivo v5s has a 3,000 mah battery for power backup .
although phones with 4,000 mah battery are available in this range today , such a battery will be said to be slightly less .
although battery backup is good .
it is able to take a full day off even after continuous use .
after looking at all the segments , it can be said that vivo v5s is a good android phone .
especially you will like selfie and performance .
at the same time , there is not too much complaint with the battery .
yes , you can say hd display as a lack .
however my complaint is with os and a lot of preloaded applications .
the os is older and more preferred than stock android .
at the same time , preloaded apps are also very much , which is not needed .
despite this , the vivo v5s will be called a good phone and you can take it .
this is very good for selfie lovers .
this phone will get stiff competition from devices like gionee a1 and oppo f3 .
recently , moto has informed that soon moto e4 plus will be launched in india .
it is reported that on july 6 , the moto e4 and e4 plus can be introduced in india where they are expected to be priced around rs 10,000 .
but before the launch of this phone in india , we have brought a glimpse of moto e4 plus for you .
in the chinese city of shanghai , we got a chance to see this phone and we wanted to make our readers aware of it .
where recently launched moto c and moto c plus were introduced by lenovo with polycarbonate body .
at the same time , moto e4 plus will be found in the metal design , which gives a premium feel .
nokia 3 review : what makes it so powerful that it will make nokia number 1 again , know
it has been introduced in the unibody design where you cannot change the phone battery by yourself .
we had a gray colored phone available for viewing .
the moto e4 has a 5.5-inch hd screen .
we liked the display of the phone .
the screen of the phone is gorilla glass 3 and oleophobic coated , which protects it from scratches and will reduce finger movements on the screen .
the moto e4 plus is the first phone in the e series to be equipped with a fingerprint scanner .
the fingerprint sensor is provided on the home button in the phone .
the phone has a 13-megapixel rear camera .
the placement of the camera is the same as we have seen in the moto g5 and moto c.
camera and flash are available inside a circle .
the moto e4 plus has a 5-megapixel secondary camera .
you will also get flash with front camera .
the phone we received works on the mediatek mt6737 chipset to see that the phone has a 1.4 ghz quadcore processor .
but remember that there is another version introduced on the qualco mm snapdragon 427 chipset .
this phone has 16 gb internal memory with 3 gb ram .
along with this , memory card support up to 128 gb .
the moto e4 plus android operating system works on 7.1.1 nougat and you will get a clean and clean interface in the phone .
the biggest feature of this phone of moto is the big battery .
the company claims that this phone is capable of giving two days of battery backup .
with a large battery , the moto e4 plus has been given a fast charger with a sales pack for fast charging .

today , when it comes to budget friendly watch , firstly people mention timemax .
for the past several years , the company has managed to make a good hold in the indian market on the basis of excellent looks and waterproof devices at low prices .
however , despite the increasing craze of smartwatches , the segment has not seen much good effort from the company so far .
but recently , timax has tried to overcome this shortcoming by launching a hybrid watch equipped with stylish and smart features .
the company has introduced timex iq + smartwatch priced at rs 9,995 .
in such a situation , it remains to be seen whether this watch is worth buying at this price or not .
like its old watches , timex has introduced this watch in analog design as well .
in such a situation , you will find it a little less beautiful than a smartwatch .
rather you can say that at first glance you will not even realize that timex iq + is a smartwatch .
its body is made of metal which comes with rubberized strap .
timex has made it with sports lovers in mind and in such a situation , you can not only do sports by wearing it but also get into the water because the company has made it waterproof .
the company claims that you can take it up to 50 meters underwater .
a glimpse of oneplus 5 : see how powerful this phone is
like every watch , it will also get a clip on the right side , which is very useful for you .
with this , you will be able to set the time as well as light blue light burns when you press it for a while .
not only this , with the help of this clip , you will be able to connect this smartwatch to your mobile phone .
to connect this watch to the phone , you will need an application from timex which is available on the play store .
if you look at the timex iq + dial , you will see four forks in it .
of which 3 are there to tell the time , while the fourth fork has been equipped with smart features .
when you connect this watch to your phone , it will tell you how many steps you have taken and the distance you have covered .
this watch is also able to tell you how many calories you have burned and how deep you have slept .
however , you cannot see these things on the watch screen .
you have to see it in the smartphone that is connected to this watch .
although when we tested the timex iq + watch , it said the steps count was correct but we could not give the exact information of the distance covered .
that is , this clock was telling 3.8 km to 3 km distance .
apart from these little data , the benefit of this smartwatch is not much .
after looking at all the features and specifications of the timeax iq + smartwatch , the question finally arises as to whether it should be bought or not .
so not according to us .
because of the budget of about ten thousand rupees , this device is expensive in terms of features .
if you buy a stylish analog watch from any other brand or timeax with a little money , it is better .
the features that are available in the timex iq + smartwatch will be similar to those found in the smartphone .
for the past several years , indian mobile consumers have been waiting for nokia &apos;s android phones and this month hmd global has simultaneously launched 3 nokia android phones in india .
the company has also introduced nokia 5 and nokia 6 along with nokia 3 .
although nokia 5 and 6 will be available for sale from next month , but 3 has already arrived in india where its price is rs 9,499 .
people are also very keen to know about this phone .
how is this phone ? is it powerful enough to be called the best phone in your budget and can nokia come back again through it ? during our review , we have tried to find the answer to these questions .
seeing the phone , you can say that the quality of nokia is reflected in it .
the body of the nokia 3 is on the metal frame and the back panel is made of polycarbonate plastic .
although today , even in the budget of less than rs 10,000 , you will get phones with good metallic body , but still you cannot underestimate it in look and quality .
the corners of the phone are curved and its weight is also quite good .
it will make you feel very good when held in the hand .
the nokia 3 is available in unibody design .
you cannot open the back panel , in such a case , the sim and memory card slots will be found in the side panels of the phone , you will need an ejector to open it and that is with the sales pack .
overall we can say that we liked the design of nokia 3 quite well .
at the same time , it will also make you feel a little older nokia smartphone .
nokia 3 has a 5-inch 2.5d curved ips screen .
it also has screen resolution hd ( 720 × 1280 pixels ) .
the screen of the phone is coated with corning gorilla glass which protects it .
at the same time , the company has also used a polarized layer on the screen so that you can read things on the screen easily even in bright sunlight .
we used it in strong sunlight where we were able to see things clearly .
the matter of display quality is very good .
you cannot wish for anything better in this budget .
at the same time , the touch response of the screen is also better .
nokia 3 has been introduced by the company on the mediatek 6737 chipset and has been given a 1.3 ghz cortex a53 processor for better processing .
along with this , the mali-t is 720 mp2 gpu .
the phone has 2 gb ram and 16 gb internal memory .
along with this , it also has memory card support where you can use cards up to 128 gb .
out of 16 gb memory , the user gets about 9 gb memory .
at the same time , without any app usage , out of 2 gb you get only 0.8 gb free .
in such a situation , it can be said that you cannot run big games and apps in it .
at the same time , in the case of processor also , this phone is slightly behind .
in phones above rs 9,000 , you can wish for a phone with better processor and memory up to 32 gb .
however during the experiment we downloaded some big apps and games in it .
was able to run games and apps but was taking a little time to open apps .
honor 8 lite : slow processing in spite of great stylish look and excellent photography filters
this nokia phone runs on android operating system 7.1 nougat .
the phone has stock android which you can also call pure android .
you will not get any extra layer in it .
the user interface of the phone is quite smooth and you will also have fun during use .
apart from google apps , the company has not given any additional apps in it , so you can download the app of your choice by yourself .
as it is known , in the new os you will find options like slide quick menu and editable quick settings .
at the same time , in the new os you will not find the menu button , but an arrow will appear on the home screen , clicking it , you can open the apps tray .
at the same time , nokia has also assured it of further android updates .
it can be said here that the company has tried to overcome the lack of hardware with software and it is also successful to a great extent .
nokia 3 has 8-megapixel front and back camera .
in the previous panel , you will see camera placement in the old nokia style itself .
f / 2.0 aperture is used in both the rear and front cameras .
the quality of the picture taken from the phone is good but can not say very good .
we wished for better from nokia phones .
it was taking a good picture in the outdoor where there are good lighting conditions , but picture pixels were taking place in the indoor .
it is a selfie camera that the situation is not much different there .
moto c plus first glance : the latest android with big battery makes it special but slightly behind in design
talking about data and connectivity , you will get dual sim support in nokia 3 and this phone is equipped with 4g volte .
although the phone does not have a fingerprint sensor , but you will get nfc .
during the experiment , we had no problem in using wifi connectivity or internet access .
yes , it is necessary to mention one thing that you will get crystal clear sound during calling .
nekia phones are known for excellent battery backup from the beginning .
it will get 2,650 mah battery .
although today there are a lot of phones with 3,000 and 4,000 mah batteries , it can be said that the battery optimization is very good and once fully charged , it is able to drain easily one day .
it can be said that the battery will not disappoint .
after looking at the design , specification and camera of nokia 3 , finally comes the conclusion , let me tell you that the design is great , the display is also very good , in terms of software upgrades .
the shortage can be called processor and camera .
at the same time , it is a big thing to not have a fingerprint sensor in a phone worth rs 9,000 .
we liked this phone despite these slight drawbacks .
yes , if you buy the phone from the online store , then you have other options like xiaomi redmi 4 and redmi note 4 .
but it is the best phone in terms of offline .
as for nokia &apos;s return , my opinion in that matter is clear .
this is not the phone from which you can say that nokia is ready to return .
we were expecting something better from the company .
after several months of aggravation , oneplus finally launched its flagship device oneplus 5 in india .
there is a lot of curiosity about this phone , because on the one hand , while oneplus launches one model in a year , on the other hand , the company &apos;s phones are known as flagship keylers .
the same is being said about oneplus 5 .
this phone was also available to us for testing .
although it has not been long since then , we have not published a full review of the phone , but you can see a glimpse .
oneplus 5 is very stylish to look at .
its look will attract you a lot .
although talking about newness in design , you will not get much from looking from the front .
this is similar to the oneplus 3t that the company launched last year .
however , this time the phone is a bit more slim .
yes , if you look at the previous panel , there is a lot of change .
you will find the antenna band at the top like the apple iphone .
at the same time , the camera was given in the middle of the old phone .
this time there is a little upward corner .
the overall matching design is good and it is less slippery than before in the grip meaning less slipping .
oneplus 5 has a 5.5-inch full hd screen .
the company has used an optic amoled screen whose screen resolution is 1080 × 1920 pixels .
the screen of the phone is corning gorilla glass 5 coated , which protects it from minor scratches .
the display of the phone is good and the touch response is also better .
oneplus 5 has been introduced on qualco mm &apos;s most powerful chipset snapdragon 835 .
along with this , 2.45 ghz kryo processor has been given .
the phone has 64 gb memory with 6 gb ram , while 128 gb internal storage will be available with 8 gb ram variants .
currently it is the first phone in india which has 8 gb ram memory .
as far as performance is concerned , obviously the phone with a large ram memory is very good with powerful chipset .
yes , you will not see the effect of 8 gb ram everywhere .
will appear when you play a big game or open the application .
we cannot give more information about this because of not using it for a long time .
but you can definitely say that it was fun to use .
oneplus 5 has been introduced on oxygen os which is android nougat based on android operating system 7.1 .
in this , you will get to see 3d touch and new android menu .
there are not many apps preloaded in the phone , you can download it yourself as per your need .
the camera of oneplus has been the most discussed after the processor and ram .
this phone will get a 16-megapixel + 20-megapixel camera , which is available with f / 1.7 and f / 2.6 aperture respectively .
the quality of the picture taken with the camera is very good and you can consider it one of the best camera phones .
it is capable of supporting optical zoom up to 2x .
it has a depth mode where you can blur the background by focusing the subject .
eia ( electronic image stabilization ) feature has been provided with the phone , which is helpful in taking a clear picture even when it is moving .
oneplus 5 has a 16-megapixel selfie camera .
with the selfie camera you will not get much option .
the phone can record video in full hd resolution .
this phone has dual sim support and nano sim is used in both slots .
there is wifi bluetooth with 4g volte for data .
fingerprint is enabled on the home button itself .
during connectivity we did not find any problem from anywhere .
for power backup , oneplus 5 has a battery of 3,300 mah and it supports fast charging .
dash charger has been provided with the phone &apos;s sales pack , through which you can fully charge the phone within an hour .
last month , huawei &apos;s sub-brand honor introduced the honor 8 lite model in the indian market .
the price of this phone in the indian market is rs 17,999 .
in india , this phone is also available for sale at almost all offline stores .
if you look at this budget , then samsung &apos;s phones like galaxy prime are already holding theirs in the online , while the offline competes with selfie-centric phones like oppo f3 and vivo v5s .
in such a situation , during two weeks of use , we wanted to know whether the honor 8 lite is so great that samsung can compete with brands like oppo and vivo .
honor 8 lite is a light phone that is smart to look at .
for those who like to keep the phone in hand more than pocket , this can be called the best choice .
built on the slim dual 2.5d unibody design , this phone looks equally attractive on both the front and back panels .
the back layer with a glass layer is so shiny that its face can also be seen clearly , and this is the reason why the company has added the &apos; reflects you &apos; tag line with this phone .
however , despite shiny black , fingerprints are rarely seen , which can be called very good .
the body of the phone is only 7.6  mm thick and its design with a slightly slanted edge makes the iphone 7 feel somewhat .
the outer surface of the phone is quite soft and smooth , which gives it a good look but it also makes it a little slippery when held in the hand .
that is , during chatting or gaming , this phone slips with hands .
in such a situation , you have to think that for a strong grip , put it in the mobile cover or flaunt its look without the cover .
overall , the same can be said about the design that is good and one of the best looking phones in this budget .
honor 8 lite has a 5.2-inch 2.5d curved fullhd screen with 1080 x 1920 pixels resolution .
the pixel density of the phone is 423 ppi .
we did not receive any complaints in the display .
the &apos; i comfort &apos; mode given in the phone does not let the phone light prick in the eyes while reading or watching something in the phone , while its auto bright feature provides clear visibility even in bright sunlight .
in playing games and chatting continuously , we found that the marks of sweat or dirty fingers on the smooth screen of the phone are also easily cleared .
honor 8 lite has 64 gb of internal storage with 4 gb of ram , which can be increased to 128 gb via card .
this phone works on huawei &apos;s kirin 655 chipset and has a 2.1 ghz octa-core processor .
this phone is android 7.0 nougat based which is based on the company &apos;s own emotion ui 5.0 .
honor 8 lite offers pre-installed social apps like honor cloud , health care as well as instagram and facebook .
talking about the performance of the phone , despite having 4 gb ram , we found this phone a bit slow .
this lag may also be due to the emotion ui because earlier we have heard this kind of complaint in honor &apos;s phone .
in this way , you can control someone else &apos;s phone , call , messaging and use the camera
however , if you are one of those people who keep multiple tabs of multi-tasking or multiple features of the phone at once : such as whatsapp , facebook , gallery and internet browser , then this phone may bother you a bit .
speed ​ ​ of your fingers during chatting can beat the phone &apos;s processing .
along with this , while playing the game , we also got complaints of phone heating up .
honor 8 lite has a 12-megapixel rear camera equipped with led flash , which is equipped with pdaf technology .
likewise , it has an 8-megapixel 77-degree wide angle lens front camera with an f / 2.0 aperture for selfie .
the beauty mode and filters in the phone make your photo even more beautiful .
while the pro photo mode with the rear camera of the phone helps in clicking professional photos , the features like type laps , slow motion and light painting make any photo or movement cool and new .
similarly , while taking selfie , the pre-loaded face beauty filter mode will fulfill your selfie hobby .
finally , talk about camera quality , picture quality is good in good light , but photos were being pixelated when the light was low .
the phone has a 3,000 mah battery which is equipped with smart power 5.0 technology .
according to the company &apos;s claim , it is capable of providing more than 90 hours of battery backup .
during the experiment , we have found that the battery of the phone charges fast and during the charging , there was no complaint of heating the phone .
but battery backup is not good .
if the battery of your phone is less than 20 percent and you sleep comfortably with an alarm set in the morning , it can cheat you even when the power saving mode is on .
it can be said that if you are going out for the whole day , then it is better to carry a phone charger or power bank .
one day comes out with great difficulty .
after using this phone for almost two weeks in every way , we found that honor 8 lite is a great smartphone in terms of design , style and look .
in this case , it is better than oppo f3 and vivo v5 .
the specifications of the phone are also good but it is average in camera and performance .
at the same time , the battery will also disappoint you a bit .
overall , it can be said that this honor 8 is a good phone but in this budget phones like moto g5 plus and vivo v5 prove to be much better .
only last month lenovo brand motorola showcased two phones in the new c series .
moto c and moto c plus .
the moto c model was launched in india early this month .
however , this phone of the budget category was introduced specifically for offline stores .
at the same time , the company has introduced moto c plus which has been kept exclusive online .
in such a situation , everyone would like to know how this new phone of moto is .
is it retaining the quality of moto or has the company tied up with the phone .
this phone of moto was also available to us for testing where we got a chance to spend some time with that phone .
based on that , we are presenting you the first impressions and first glimpse of this smartphone .
the moto c plus has been introduced in a very colorful box .
a wall charger , a usb cable and manual will be available with the sales pack .
you will also get a simple earphone with the phone .
talking about the design , let us know that its body is made of polycarbonate plastic .
however , you will not find it very attractive to watch .
due to the large battery it is also slightly heavier and its thickness also seems to be slightly more than today &apos;s smartphone .
seems quite strong to hold on to though .
you can remove the phone &apos;s backpanel and battery .
that is , you can change the battery by yourself , but it is important to mention one thing here that it is very difficult to open its back panel .
it is very tightly closed .
on opening the rear panel you will see the sim card slot and microsd card slot .
to install a sim and a card , you must remove the battery .
in the rear panel , you will find a loudspeaker grill .
speaking of the overall design , the moto c plus is a strong and durable phone but cannot be called attractive .
moving to other features , the moto c plus has a 5-inch hd display .
its viewing angles are good and the combination of colors will also get better .
however , you will be a little disappointed that it does not have the adaptive brightness feature .
that is , it does not adjust brightnet according to the light itself .
you will have to do less and more brightness by yourself .
however , we did not face any problem in using this phone in sunlight .
talking about the performance , many people will complain that it has a quadcore processor but let me tell that it was working correctly in the days we used it .
during this time we played games like sub-way surfer and temple run which were running without any problems .
the moto c plus has been given the power of 2 gb ram memory along with 16 gb internal memory in the phone .
the phone &apos;s memory can be expanded through the card .
moto c works on the latest android device .
along with this , you will also get features like google assistant .
as far as unnecessary applications are concerned , moto c plus does not have any kind of extra apps .
for connectivity , it has 4g volte support with dual sim .
however you will not get fingerprint sensor .
for photography , the moto c plus has an 8-megapixel autofocus rear shooter and a 2-megapixel front camera .
you will get led flash with both .
the device &apos;s camera app comes with functions like hdr and beautification mode .
however , you will not get many filters in beautification .
the photos we pulled from the rear and front camera of the phone were good but can not say very good .
now we come to the biggest highlight of the moto c plus - the battery .
this phone comes with a 4,000 mah battery .
the company claims that it supports fast charge .
however , it comes with a simple 2 watt charger .
overall , the moto c plus is a good phone in this budget .
there are strong built , good camera , latest android and big battery features .
however , the lack of options like plastic body , simple design and fingerprint sensor can be called a big drawback .
the price of this phone in the indian market is rs 6,999 and in this budget phones like xiaomi redmi 4 and coolpad note 5 lite can get a tough challenge .
today once again rip rivals are in front .
in the budget phone category , both of them have seen a tough competition from the beginning , where one is beaten and the other is seen beating it .
yes , we are talking about the famous brands of online xiaomi and moto .
recently , xiaomi launched the m4 model in india with an initial price of rs 6,999 .
in this budget , it is being called a very great phone .
today , moto has introduced moto c plus in the indian market , which is priced at rs 6,999 .
now both brands are in this budget .
not only this , the competition here can also be called two big ecommerce sites of the country .
while xiaomi redmi 4 is available for sale on amazon india online , moto c plus is being sold from flipkart .
in such a situation , this subject of victory and defeat is also for these two big companies .
so let &apos;s take a look at the look and features of moto c plus and xiaomi redmi 4 and see who is a better phone .
learn 20 big things about nokia 6 , why this phone is special
in terms of design , you will call xiaomi redmi 4 the best , its body is made of metal and will make you feel of the best quality .
we did not see this kind of phone in this budget .
at the same time , its small size will attract you a lot .
it is a good thing about moto , but you will not get the kind of quality you feel from a motorola phone .
this phone made of polycarbonate is a little thick to see and you cannot call it a very good looking phone .
redmi 4 has a 5-inch hd display .
it has 2.5d curved glass and also has screen coating .
although the company has not given information about the coating , but the display is quite attractive .
talking about moto c plus , it also has a 5-inch screen and its screen resolution is also hd .
although the moto does not have a 2.5d curved glass screen , it will be said to be behind xiaomi .
vivo y66 review : perfect combination of style , performance and feature but slightly expensive
the xiaomi redmi 4 works on qualco mm &apos;s snapdragon 435 chipset and has a 1.4 ghz octa-core processor .
at the same time , the phone with rs 6,999 has 2 gb ram and 16 gb internal memory .
this processor will be called very good in this budget .
at the same time , moto c plus has been introduced on the mediatek mt 6737 chipset and has a 1.3 ghz quadcore processor .
along with this , you will also get 2 gb ram and 16 gb internal memory in this phone .
ram and memory are equal but in terms of processor , moto lags behind .
talking about the redmi 4 , it has a 13-megapixel rear camera .
for the selfie , it has a 5-megapixel front camera .
the picture quality of the phone is good .
for photography , the moto c plus has an 8-megapixel rear camera .
there is a 2-megapixel front camera .
flash will also be available with the front camera .
however , if you see , in terms of camera too , moto redmi 4 is far behind .
shaomi redmi 4 dual sim support will be available .
there is also 4g volte support .
however the second slot is hybrid where you can use only one of the sims or cards .
at the same time , you will also get dual sim support in moto c plus .
along with this , there is also 4g volte support .
it has a detached memory card slot , so you can use a microsd card with two sims .
in such a situation , it can be said that the moto wins the game here .
in xiaomi redmi 4 , you will get 4,100 mah battery .
at the same time , in moto c plus , you will get 4,000 mah battery .
although moto is not far behind in this , but only xiaomi gets ahead by a small margin .
bonus
at the same time , you will get a fingerprint sensor in xiaomi redmi 4 .
apart from this , the phone has an ir blaster , which you can also use the phone as a tv remote .
not only this , it has a dual profile where you can run two whatsapp and two google play stores simultaneously .
you will also like redmi 4 in terms of music .
all these features are not available in moto .
in such a situation , you can clearly know that if you omit the dual sim feature , then xiaomi redmi 4 falls on moto c plus in every respect including design , processor , camera and battery .
so it can be said that if you like shopping online then xiaomi redmi 4 is better than moto c plus .
finally it can be said that due to the redmi 4 , in this battle of two ecommerce websites , amazon is seen to be winning by flipkat .
hmd global finally launched nokia phones in the indian market .
indian consumers have been waiting for nokia phones for a long time .
the company has simultaneously launched 3 phones , among which the cheapest is nokia 3 .
the price of this phone in the indian market is rs 9,499 .
the tough challenge of the phone in this budget is from xiaomi redmi 4 , which the company has recently launched .
in such a situation , the question arises whether nokia 3 is so powerful that xiaomi is capable of competing with redmi 4 or whether people should maintain their trust in xiaomi in this budget .
style and look
overall , this phone has the power to attract you at the first glance .
the body of nokia 3 is made of metal and polycarbonate .
mattel frame is used while back panel is given of polycarbonate .
the site of the phone is curved which makes it comfortable to hold .
the phone is good to watch but cannot be said to be equal to the redmi 4 .
screen and display
redmi 4 has a 5-inch hd display .
for this reason , it felt very spectacular .
the screen is coated but the company did not name .
nokia 3 has a 5-inch 2.5d curved ips screen .
in such a situation , it can be said that in the case of nokia 3 display , redmi is a bit heavy .
that is , with better processing , you can also feel great gaming .
along with this , the mali-t720mp2 gpu has been given .
in terms of processor , redmi 4 is ahead .
ram and memory
xiaomi redmi 4 has been introduced with 2 gb , 3 gb and 4 gb ram memory .
its gb ram model is available in the nokia 3 budget .
in this phone with 3 gb ram , you will get 32 ​ ​ gb memory .
nokia 3 has 2 gb ram and 16 gb internal memory .
in this case , you can see that this nokia phone is far behind xiaomi redmi 4 .
nokia 3 has an 8-megapixel front and back camera .
in such a situation , you can say that xiaomi is ahead in the rear camera , then the front camera is better than nokia .
however , it is worth noting that in terms of camera , nokia has not been a mash since the beginning .
at the same time , nokia 3 has been introduced on android operating system 7.0 nougat and in it you will get stock android which can be called better than xiaomi &apos;s mui .
with this , it will get further updates .
in such a situation , it can be said that nokia is far ahead of the redmi 4 .
nokia 3 is dual sim support .
it has a separate microsd card slot with dual sim .
you can use 4g in both sims .
at the same time , volte support has also been provided .
xiaomi redmi 4 has a battery of 4,100 mah .
the nokia 3 has a 2,650 mah battery .
in such a situation , it can be said that nokia 3 is far behind .
however , one thing to note here is that battery optimizations in nokia phones are better from the beginning .
nokia 3 is priced at rs 9,499 .
on the other hand , for xiaomi redmi 4 , you have to pay rs 8,999 .
nokia is ahead in software and sim connectivity but is ahead in other features including look , battery and hardware .
in such a situation , if you look at all the sides , you can say that xiaomi redmi 4 is a better device and if you buy online , then redmi 4 is a better option for you , but nokia can be called a strong phone for offline .

about a year later , micromax brand u has introduced the eureka black model in india .
in such a situation , there is a lot of discussion about this phone .
in terms of price , the specifications of the phone are good , even in style it is not less than anyone .
the price of this phone in the indian market is rs 8,999 and this phone is available for sale on online store flipkart .
however , in this budget , you have a direct competition with yureka black , the king of online , xiaomi .
recently , xiaomi has launched redmi 4 in india , which is considered to be a very special phone .
the 3 gb variant of redmi 4 is available for rs 8,999 only .
in such a situation , the question becomes very important for those who buy online phones , which of the two phones is better for them .
next , we have taken competition of both phones in every segment and you can see the result of this yourself .
yu yureka is in black glass finish .
you will find glass in both front and back .
the look of the phone is good and has the power to attract at first sight but due to the glass , fingerprints fall quickly .
in terms of design , if both phones come to choose one , then i will choose xiaomi redmi 4 .
as far as yu yureka black is concerned , it has a 5-inch fullhd display .
the screen resolution of the phone is 1920x1080 pixels .
the company has used 2.5d curved glass in it which is protected with corning gorilla glass 3 .
in such a situation , it can be said that in terms of display , yu yureka black is much better .
first glimpse of asus zenfone live : we did its live test , see results
processor
in the model of rs 8,999 , you will get 32 ​ ​ gb memory with 3 gb of ram .
yu yureka black has been introduced on qualco mm snapdragon 430 chipset and the phone has a 1.4 ghz octa-core processor .
along with this , 4 gb ram memory and 32 gb internal memory has been given .
the phone also has microsd card support up to 128 gb .
in terms of processor , xiaomi leads by a slight margin , but ram is more than that of the urega black and is 1 gb more .
in this case , you would call eureka black much better .
xiaomi redmi 4 has a 13-megapixel rear and 5-megapixel selfie camera .
with the camera you will get features like pdaf .
the eureka black has a 13-megapixel rear camera and an 8-megapixel selfie camera .
the special thing can be said that with both cameras you will get flash .
eureka is also heavy in the camera segment .
xiaomi redmi 4 has dual sim support but the second slot is highbreid where you can use either sim or memory card .
the phone has 4g volte support and will get an ir blaster .
allowing it to be used as a universal remote .
along with this , fingerprint casser has been given for security .
you eureka black also has dual sim support and you will also get 4g volte support .
the phone has a fingerprint sensor but not an ir blaster and here xiaomi goes ahead .
both phones operate on the android operating system 6.0 and the manufacturers of both phones have assured 7.0 nougat .
at the same time , a 3,000 mah battery has been given in yureka black .
in this case , you can see that redmi 4 is far ahead of eureka black in terms of battery .
where xiaomi redmi 4 falls heavily in design , battery and connectivity .
at the same time , the eureka black wins the display , ram and camera .
in such a situation , it is difficult to say better than one phone , but if it comes to choosing one , then my vote will probably go to xiaomi redmi 4 .
superb battery backup with a very attractive look proves it to be the best phone .
yes if you are a selfie lover then eureka black is definitely a better choice for you .
in mobile accessories , the name jabra is quite old and when it comes to good bluetooth at a low price , jabra &apos;s name comes first .
recently the company has launched the jabra talk 2 bluetooth headset .
this device of the company was also available to us for review .
however , this time we were reviewing a product of jabra after a long time , in such a situation , with the functionality of the headset , we also tried to know whether the quality of the jabra device is still the same or whether the company has made an agreement in it .
jabra talk 2 looks like a smart device and its body of polycarbonate will also make you feel good .
in this bluetooth headset available in black color , you will find the calling button in addition to the volume and power buttons .
although the calling button will not be visible to you , it is attached to the body , but if you press the body from above , it is clickable .
with the headset you will get flexible earlocks which help it to set easily on the ears .
at the same time , this device weighs only 8 grams .
overall , it is fantastic when it comes to built quality .
this will make you feel premium quality .
due to being lighter , you can keep it on your ears for a longer time .
its stylish design will add to the personality of you .
talking about the features of jabra talk 2 , this company has introduced bluetooth 4.0 .
this version of bluetooth is known for low power consumption .
this device is capable of connecting with android and ios devices .
the company has claimed talk range of up to 30 meters .
the company has equipped it with hd voice feature which gives the assurance of talking with clear and clear voice .
the company has claimed 9 hours of talk time for jabra talk 2 .
we used it for over 20 days during the experiment and this device was able to function optimally .
as seen earlier , jabra devices easily connect with other phones , we did not face any problem in this .
the clickable button of the body is even better . in order to pick up the call , the fingers easily reach there and believe it gives a very good feeling .
on dialing the calling button twice consecutively it dials the last call .
yes , there was a slight echo in the voice during a call twice , but it cannot be said whether the device was deficient or not .
because sometimes it happens because of network .
there was a lack of noise cancellation .
because it was also covering the surrounding voice while talking .
at the same time , earbuds should also be a little more comfortable .
talking about battery backup , this device is capable of giving 9 hours of battery backup .
this device also has a vice assistant which is very useful for you .
it will keep you informed during the call or while connecting .
it stops at the cost of seeing everything ! how much does it cost and is it right according to its price ? so let me tell you that the price of jabra talk 2 is rs 2,099 .
the features are good and the quality is superb .
those functions that function well , despite this , it will be called expensive in this price .
today in india , you will find vivo banners everywhere and vivo phones are also decorated in shops .
in the last few years , the company has strengthened its grip in india and today vivo phones can be seen in the shop up to the street .
but there is still some doubt in the indian consumer &apos;s mind about vivo , whether vivo phone should be taken ? how is their quality , will these phones last longer and are vivo &apos;s phones better than brands like samsung and motorola ? we also had vivo &apos;s y66 model for testing .
the price of this phone is rs 14,990 and we also tried to know the same in our test and weighed the phone on every scale .
we begin our test with design .
the vivo y66 is offered in unibody metal design .
with a thickness of 7.6  mm , this phone is slim to watch .
despite the metal body , there is a metal ring around the phone that separates the main panel from the back panel .
the vivo y66 has the volume and power buttons on the right while the sim tray is on the left .
to remove the sim tray , a sim ejector is required which is provided with the sales pack .
usb slot , 3.5 mm audio jack and loudspeaker are available in all three lower panels .
overall , the design of the phone is good and you will like it too .
you can not call it too heavy , in such a situation , you will not feel very uncomfortable while holding it in your hand or in your pocket .
its mantle is slightly out of the ring body , sometimes it feels in the palm , but this phone is beautiful .
the vivo y66 uses a 5-inch ips 2.5d curved glass .
the screen resolution of the phone is 1280x720 pixels .
however , in the budget in which y66 has been launched , phones with full hd screen are available in that budget .
in such a situation , some people may find it less but as far as the display quality is concerned , it will not disappoint you .
its display is quite bright and you can see it clearly even in harsh sunlight .
not only this , the phone has a protection feature which you can use in low light or at night , it will not affect the eyes much .
xiaomi redmi 4 vs xiaomi redmi 4a , know who is the better choice
the vivo y66 has been launched on the mediatek mt 6750 chipset .
the phone has a 64 ghz octa-core processor of 1.5 ghz .
along with this is the mali-860 gpu .
the y66 is provided with 3 gb of ram and you will get 32 ​ ​ gb of internal memory .
however , only 23.3 gb memory will be available for the user .
the phone has memory card support up to 256 gb .
however , the slot in the phone is hybrid where you can use any memory card or sim .
if you look at the hardware , you can say the processor is a little less , but the rest of the phones with almost the same specification are available in this range .
in such a situation , a lot of lack can not be removed .
the vivo y66 runs on the funtouch os funtouch os 3.0 based on the android operating system 6.0 marshmallow .
in this , you will see the menu on the home screen itself .
this phone of vivo has many apps preloaded .
but the good thing can be said that you can uninstall many of them .
there is not much to tell in terms of software .
yes , where you can find the quick settings in the ordinary android phone at the top , you will get it by swiping from the bottom of the screen .
the notification menu of the phone is divided into two panels , which you can see by swiping from right to left .
vivo y66 has been specially introduced as a selfie phone .
the company has introduced it with a 16-megapixel selfie camera and moonlight flash .
along with this , a 13-megapixel rear camera is also available .
first of all talk about selfie , there is no doubt that it will impress you .
in this budget , you can call y66 the best selfie phone .
at the same time , its moonlight flash will help in taking good selfies in low light .
in this , you will get preloaded face filter mode which works quite well .
yes , looking at the main camera , you cannot call it the best camera phone .
in this budget , it is slightly behind the phone like honor 6x and moto g5 .
if we look at all the specifications and features of vivo y66 , then you will find that it is a little behind in terms of processor because in this range , phones with chipsets like qualco mm snapdragon 652 and snapdragon 625 are available today .
but in terms of performance , we did not find any shortage from anywhere .
we used this phone for more than 20 days and during this time we played a lot of games and used many apps simultaneously but it did not slow down and there was no hanging .
yes it was taking a little longer to open some apps than we were not expecting .
the vivo y66 has a 3,000 mah battery .
is able to take a full day off despite well usage .
one day can say no more than this .
the same phone does not have fast charging support .
this dual sim based phone has 4g volte support for connectivity .
yes , if you believe the biggest drawback of this phone is that there is no fingerprint sensor .
today , fingerprint sensors are also available in phones worth rs 7,000 , but if it is not available in the budget of about rs 13,000 then it can be called a huge reduction .
after checking vivo y66 in all segments , it can be said that it is a great phone in terms of quality and performance and you can take it .
yes , it can definitely be said to be a bit expensive .
the price of vivo y66 is rs 14,990 .
if you compare this phone with the phone available online , then it will be said to be a bit expensive .
devices like xiaomi redmi note 4 and moto g5 plus weigh on it , but it will be called a good device at the offline store .
in this budget , a tough challenge to the vivo y66 at offline stores can be met with devices like gionee s6s .
today , leading taiwanese computer manufacturer asus has launched the indian smartphone market zenfone live .
as its name suggests , asus is trying to capitalize on the latest trend of live video streaming with its latest smartphone .
the company claims that it is the world &apos;s first smartphone which is equipped with real time beautification feature .
this phone of asus was also available to us for testing .
but before the complete test , we have presented the first glimpse of it to you .
first of all talk about the sales pack , then along with the sales pack of asus zenfone live , you will get charging cable and power adapter .
the company has not provided earphones .
if you look at the design , it will impress you a lot .
it is a stylish and slim smartphone .
the body of zenfone live is made of polycarbonate plastic and metal .
its build quality is good , its small size is able to come easily to the palm , but the back panel is very smooth , due to which there is a fear of slipping a little by hand .
its weight is only 120 grams .
in today &apos;s trend of heavy phones , it seems quite light .
the biggest advantage of low weight is that you can easily hold it for a long time while streaming live video .
the main panel of zenfone live will have a selfie camera with selfie flash .
with this , you will see the earpiece at the top of the screen .
at the same time , three android capacitive touch buttons are given below the screen , which are usually seen in all android phones .
the phone &apos;s power button and volume rocker are on the right .
at the same time , 3.5  mm headphone jack and the bottom side has a speakerspeaker grill with usb port .
asus has introduced zenfone live as a better selfie smartphone with video streaming .
talking about the camera , the phone has a 5-megapixel selfie camera , which is equipped with features like f / 2.2 aperture , autofocus and manual mode .
the company has introduced it with a beautify application where you can use beautification mode during live video .
it adds glow to the face and makes you look better than ever in the video .
with the real-time beautification mode you can stream live video on facebook , youtube and instagram .
the zenfone live features a 13-megapixel rear camera with f / 2.0 aperture , soft-light flash and 5p lens .
talk about camera quality photos we took their overall quality with the phone &apos;s selfie and rear camera , but can not say very good .
in some pictures , we found the color tone far different from reality .
however the good thing can be said that with the camera you will get the manual mode option , so that you can adjust the shutter speed and color accustomed according to yourself during photography .
now let &apos;s talk about other features of asus zenfone live .
the phone has a 5-inch hd display which is equipped with the company &apos;s truevivid technology .
at the same time , 2.5d curved glass is used in the phone , so it gives strength to the screen .
for the health of your eyes , the company has equipped it with blue light filters .
we loved the display of the phone .
if you compare it with other phones of this segment , then it will not only be forward or backward .
the phone is offered on a qualco mm snapdragon 410 chipset and has a 1.2 ghz quadcore processor .
with this , the strength of 2 gb ram has been provided .
here , zenfone live can be called a little back .
because the processor is a bit old and in this budget , phones with powerful processor and ram are available .
however the amount of time we have spent so far has not slowed down anywhere .
you cannot play very heavy games on this , but you can enjoy simple games like temple run and candy crush etc .
talking about the software , asus zenfone live comes with android operating system 6.0 marshmallow .
this os is a bit outdated , here we can only hope for 7.0 nougat .
the company has equipped it with zen ui 3.0 .
with this you will get many additional features like app hide , zen apps and cloud etc .
however , it will not make it feel much different from ordinary android .
the stock is largely android-like .
social networking apps like facebook and instagram are also available in this .
asus zenfone live &apos;s internal memory is 16 gb and in which you will get only 9.52 gb to use .
however , up to 128 gb memory card can be used which gives you the option to store additional data .
for connectivity , the phone will get wifi , gps and 4g volte with dual sim .
for power backup , zenfone live has a 2,650 mah battery .
in today &apos;s era of large batteries it will be called very little but it is capable of taking a full day .
it is necessary to mention one more special feature here .
zenfone live is equipped with a 5-magnet speaker and smart amplifier technology .
this technology is capable of giving you the best media experience .
while playing games or watching videos , we equipped it with dts headphone and x technology where the 7.1 channel surround sound experience with compatible headphones was excellent .
on the other hand , loudspeakers are also capable of giving this excellent sound quality .
overall , asus zenfone live is a smartphone with a great selfie camera . if you are a selfie lover and are fond of live video streaming , then this can be a good choice for you .
if you talk about the overall features , then it lags behind the specification compared to other phones .
asus zenfone live is priced at rs 9,999 in the indian market and you will find it at all offline stores in addition to offline stores .

there is no doubt that chinese mobile companies dominate the indian market today .
but there are some indian mobile manufacturers who have the power to take the iron out of them .
one such company is micromax .
after being quiet for the last few months , the company recently launched several phones one after another , including phones like the evoque note and the evoque power .
today , the company has introduced a new version of its popular phone canvas 2 .
micromax canvas 2 was introduced in the year 2012 and due to its features and specifications at that time , this phone was in the news .
today , the company has launched it with a new color look and new specifications .
micromax 2 has been launched in india , priced at rs 11,999 .
the specifications and features of the phone are very good , but this time its path will not be easy .
because there are many great phones in this budget which are seen giving it a tough competition and the first name of them is the moto g5 which is available in this budget .
next , we have checked the specifications and features of both phones , based on which you can also check which phone is better .
watch a glimpse of xiaomi mi 6 , you will be tempted by its premium look
first of all , let &apos;s talk about the design , the body of the moto g5 is made of metal , which is very stylish to look at .
the body of the phone is slightly curved and it is quite compact to look at .
in this phone too , you will get nano coating which protects it from water to some extent .
at the same time , the body of micromax canvas 2 is made of polycarbonate .
this phone is built on a metal frame and is also stylish to look at but this one of the back panel polycarbonate .
in such a situation , it can be said that its brightness looks less than the moto g5 made from metal .
on the other hand , canvas 2 is also not a water and dust blocker .
on the moto g5 plus , you will see a 5-inch screen .
the screen of the phone is gorilla glass 3 coated .
at the same time , in micromax canvas 2 , you will see a 5-inch screen .
the phone &apos;s screen resolution is hd .
although in such a situation you can call it a little back but the screen of canvas 2 is gorilla glass 5 coated .
this is the reason why the company has called it unbreakable and here this phone wins .
the moto g5 has been introduced on the qualco mm snapdragon 430 chipset .
the phone has a 1.4 ghz quadcore processor .
micromax canvas 2 has been introduced on the mediatek mt 6737 chipset .
the phone has a 1.3 ghz quadcore processor .
although there is no significant difference between the two phones here , but it is possible , but the qualco mm snapdragon 430 chipset is said to be much better .
moto g5 is 3 gb ram memory .
along with this , there is 16 gb internal memory .
the phone has memory card support up to 128 gb .
you will get the same specification in canvas 2 as well .
the phone has 16 gb internal memory with 3 gb ram .
the moto g5 has a 13-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel secondary camera .
micromax canvas 2 also has a 13-megapixel rear and 5-megapixel secondary camera for photography .
it can be said that both phones are almost equal .
the moto g5 has been introduced on the android operating system 7.0 nougat and will get further updates .
micromax canvas 2 also runs on the latest android and it also has an equal competition here .
however , nothing can be said about whether it will get the update of the new android .
the moto g5 has a 2,800 mah battery .
at the same time , in micromax canvas 2 , you will get 3,050 mah battery .
micromax proves to be far better in terms of battery .
dual sim support has also been provided in moto g5 plus .
in addition to 3g , 4g , micromax canvas 2 will also get wifi and fingerprint sensor .
there is also a fingerprint sensor on the home button itself , but nfc will not be available in it .
both micromax canvas 2 and moto g5 phones are available at a budget of rs 11,999 .
overall , both the phones are equal in specification .
yes , with a slight difference in the battery , micromax outshines it , so the moto in the processor .
if the screen protection of canvas 2 is good , then the moto in the metal design kills .
in such a situation , it is difficult to say which phone is better .
but in terms of my opinion , on the basis of quality , i would say moto g5 much better .
yes , one thing to note here is that canvas 2 will also be available at retail stores while moto g is online only .
xiaomi me6 has been launched in china and this phone has also been available for sale there .
at the same time , there is still confusion about this phone in india whether it will be launched or not .
but even before the launch of this phone in india , we have brought a glimpse of xiaomi mi 6 for you .
through these photos , you can feel the look , style and features of the phone .
in terms of design , the xiaomi mi 6 is not much different from its older version , the mi 5 .
the build quality of the phone is superb and is able to make you feel premium quality .
xiaomi mi 6 is the curve from both the front and back sites .
the phone has 2.5d curved glass and the back panel is also quite curved .
this makes the phone feel much better .
this phone has a 5.15-inch full hd screen .
the screen of the phone is laminated , which protects it from scratch .
the phone &apos;s display is excellent .
the back panel of the phone is of glass .
it looks very much like the samsung galaxy s7 and s8 .
in xiaomi me6 , the fingerprint sensor has been given on the home button itself .
it is very fast and accurate .
like the apple iphone 7 plus , the xiaomi m6 also has a 12-megapixel dual camera .
there is also a dual flash with dual cameras .
however , the flash is quite in the corner , so that there is a risk of finger on it during photography .
with the camera in the phone , you will get options such as panaroma , timer and manual control .
the quality of the picture taken from the phone was better .
for the selfie , you will get an 8-megapixel secondary camera which is also capable of hd video record .
it has usb type c for stopper and charging .
at the same time , this is the first phone of the company in which you will not get 3.5- mm jack .
in this case you have to connect the earphone using the connector in usb type c itself .
the qualco mm snapdragon 835 chipset has been introduced in the shomi mi 6 .
it has a 2.5 ghz kryo processor .
right now it can be called one of the most powerful chipsets .
m6 has 6 gb ram and 64 gb internal memory .
this phone is also available with a memory of 128 gb .
for power backup , the battery of 3,350 mah is provided in xiaomi me6 .
currently , we cannot give much information about battery backup .
the phone will also have a usb pack with power pack , rubber finish back cover with power adapter .
it does not have earphones , in it you will find usb type c connector .
today samsung has launched the galaxy s8 in india .
due to the excellent specification and powerful features , the direct competition of this phone is being considered with the apple iphone 7 .
however , many people will have the question whether apple is really better than iphone .
yes , there are many reasons , not one or two , because of which you can call samsung galaxy s8 better , further we have given 11 such reasons .
design samsung galaxy s8 is quite new this time in terms of design .
the special thing can be said that this time no hardware button will be found on the home panel of your phone .
as seen in other samsung phones .
for this reason , despite the big screen , the phone looks small and looks much smaller than the iphone 7 .
the samsung galaxy s8 and galaxy s8 plus have a 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch bezel equipped super amoled display .
the phone &apos;s screen resolution is 2k .
at the same time , you have 4.7-inch hd in iphone and 5.5-inch full hd screen in iphone 7 plus .
in such a situation , you can clearly say that samsung galaxy s8 is ahead in the display .
3. age display
this time samsung has given dual-age display in galaxy s8 and galaxy s8 plus .
at the same time , you can also put age features on dual-age display .
you will still see the flat screen on the apple iphone 7 , which is far behind the galaxy s8 .
4 . more security
samsung galaxy s8 has been introduced by the company with 3 layer security feature .
in this , you have also been given fingerprint sensor and iris scanner with pin-password , whereas in iphone 7 you will get only fingerprint scanner with pin-password .
5 . samsung desk
this feature of galaxy s8 is also amazing .
in this , you can use your phone as a computer .
you can connect samsung galaxy s8 to any monitor and you can use the phone as a laptop .
6 . bluetooth 5.0
people have discussed this very rarely , but you probably do not know that in samsung galaxy s8 you will get bluetooth 5.0 where you can connect two bluetooth devices simultaneously .
you can connect other bluetooth devices , including two headphones or two music players .
this feature is very special , but you will not find anything like this in the apple iphone 7 .
7 . fast charging
samsung galaxy s8 has been introduced by the company with fast charging support .
along with this , the phone also has wireless charging support whereas in apple iphone you will not get these features .
8 . dual sim support
samsung galaxy s8 has been introduced by the company with the dual sim feature .
however , its second sim slot is hybrid where you can use either a sim card or memory card .
but there is no dual sim support in iphone .
9 . samsung pay
samsung galaxy s8 has samsung pay support where you can integrate your debit or credit card with the phone .
while apple pay does not work in india .
10 . virtual reality
samsung galaxy s8 has vr support and the company has also introduced vr 360 headset with it .
on the iphone 7 , you will not get virtual reality .
11 . expandable memory
finally , let &apos;s talk about expandable memory .
samsung galaxy s8 has 64 gb of internal memory and can use cards up to 256 gb .
whereas in iphone , you have to depend on internal memory only .
during the mobile world congress held in february , gionee showcased two phones a1 and a1 plus in the a series .
one of these models , gionee a1 , has been launched by the company in india .
gionee has introduced this phone with great frills and has also run a campaign called selfieplan on other digital portals including tv .
this phone of about 20 thousand rupees has been specially introduced by the company as a selfie phone .
in this budget , selfie phones of companies like vivo and oppo are already present .
in such a situation , the question for consumers is that whether the gionee a1 is the best selfie phone in the budget of 20 thousand rupees or whether this model will be proved only on the exhibition , ahead of the phones of oppo and vivo .
the gionee a1 also came to us for review and we used it for about 20 days and the result was in front of you .
the budget has become more or less the mantle body standard today .
you will get to see the same in gionee a1 .
the phone is stylish to look at and will also make you feel better quality .
the body of the gionee a1 is made of a6000 aircraft grade material which was used in the iphone but the company changed it after complaining about bending .
however , we did not find such a problem in gionee .
the phone corners are a little curved .
in such a situation , despite having a big screen , the body does not prick .
see a glimpse of moto g5 , how powerful is this phone ?
in the rear panel you will see the antenna band design .
the side panel has a hardware button and sim slot while in the bottom panel you will find a loudspeaker grill .
gionee &apos;s logo is available in the rear panel itself , which looks very much like a fingerprint sensor .
however , this is not the case . the fingerprint sensor is available on the home button .
overall , we did not get any complaints in terms of design .
although a little weighty can definitely be said .
it would have been better if it had been slightly lighter .
the phone has a 2.5d curved full hd amoled screen with 5.5 inches 1080 × 1920 pixels resolution .
as is known , colors are quite blossoming in the amoled display .
the display of the phone is quite brilliant and bright .
you can see it clearly even in strong sunlight .
at the same time , it was a good thing that there were not much fingerprints on it , as seen in other touchscreen phones .
gionee a1 has been introduced on the mediatek mt6755 helia p10 chipset .
for better processing , a 2 ghz octa-core processor has been provided .
it has 4 gb ram and 64 gb inbuilt memory .
as far as performance is concerned , this phone was working properly .
we opened several apps in the phone simultaneously and also played heavy games .
but it did not find any problem .
however , before this , we had used several phones of gionee and received a lot of complaints about them getting hot .
while this time nothing was found during use .
yes , the phone was definitely getting a bit hot during charging and we also felt a little scared seeing it .
although the charger was heating up , the phone was heating up due to this .
this phone works on amigo os 4.0 based on android operating system 7.0 nougat .
we like stock android more but amigo has also been updated a lot .
all the apps will be found on the home panel , which you can slide and see .
at the same time , with nugget , you will already get features like split screen and data saver .
like samsung galaxy note , the company has given the feature in it .
you can put your favorite features on edge and use the home button by swiping right or left .
however the worst thing that happened in the ui is the pre-installed app .
there are many of these apps which are not working and you can not uninstall them and there is also no option to disable .
moods wallpaper is one of these .
as we had already informed that the company has introduced gionee a1 exclusively as a selfie phone .
in it you will get a 16-megapixel front camera .
at the same time , there is a soft flash with the camera , which is very useful for selfies .
believe we took many selfies from it during use and it was quite good .
beauty mode is also very useful for selfies .
it fills its own color according to the color tone and the photos become quite attractive .
at the same time , you will also find many filters which are very useful .
at the same time , the phone has a 13-megapixel rear camera which is available with dual tone led flash .
in the phone , you will find many modes like night , professional , time-lapse , slomotion and smart scene .
the picture quality of the phone is good , but looking at today &apos;s camera , we were expecting better .
you can use beauty mode in this too .
at the same time we got very good results from the video of the phone .
it is capable of recording videos at 1080 pixels .
it was also recording better audio with good video .
as far as music is concerned , max audio in gionee a1 which you can use in earphones as well as loudspeaker mode .
in this dual sim based phone , you can use 4g in both sims but the second slot is hybrid .
in such a situation , you can use only one of the sim or memory card .
there is wifi , bluetooth and gps for data and connectivity .
we did not find any problem in wifi connectivity in the phone .
for power backup , the phone has a 4010 mah battery and after use it can be said that the battery backup of the phone is very good .
you can use it comfortably for two days once fully charged .
in gionee , we have seen phones with good battery backup before .
the gionee a1 is priced at rs 19,999 and is available for sale at offline stores .
during testing we used this phone for a long time and after this we can say that this phone is not less than its competitors in any case .
the design of the phone is good , the battery backup is excellent , the picture quality is also good .
however , after being good , we cannot call it the best .
its user interface will initially bother you a bit .
at the same time , in this budget , you have phones with qualco mm snapdragon 820 chipset , so in the specification you can also call it a little back .
in this budget , the phone can get tough competition from phones like vivo v5 and oppo f1s .
both of these phones are available at a slightly lower price than the gionee a1 but remember that they are also a bit older and are running on an older version of android while gionee works on the nugget and gives you advanced functionality .
with the sales pack of gionee a1 , you will get a manual , charger , sim ejector , micro uac cable , earphones and a back cover .
although having a back cover would be nice , but we used it without a cover because the build quality of the phone is good but the back cover is of low level and after applying the cover it does not feel

the good thing can be said that you can open the back panel of moto g5 and change the battery yourself .

xiaomi has introduced the redmi note 4a in the indian market .
this is the cheapest android phone of the company so far .
this phone has been launched in the indian market for rs 5,999 and from march 23 this phone will be available for sale on amazon india .
it is considered to be the best phone in a budget of less than rs 6,000 .
but by paying more than rs 1,000 , xiaomi &apos;s redmi 3s is available and that too is a great phone .
in such a situation , the question is , is redmi 4a better or should we take redmi 3s by paying rs 1,000 ? according to me , xiaomi redmi 3s prime is much better and we have given the reason for this further .
1 . metal body
the xiaomi redmi 4a has been introduced with a plastic polycarbonate body while the redmi 3s is in a prime metal finish .
redmi 3s will make you feel a premium phone .
at the same time , there are many curves in it which will make you feel good .
in such a situation , we can say that xiaomi redmi 3s is better in terms of design .
2. big battery
the xiaomi redmi 4a has a 3120 mah battery , while the xiaomi redmi 3s has a 4100 mah battery , which is capable of giving you a much better battery backup than the redmi 4a .
3 . better performance
the xiaomi redmi 4a has been introduced on the qualco mm snapdragon 425 chipset and has a 1.4 ghz quadcore processor .
at the same time , the redmi 3s has been introduced on the qualco mm snapdragon 430 chipset , although you will also get a 1.4 ghz quadcore processor , but the redmi 3s chipset is better than the 4a by a small margin .
xiaomi &apos;s cheapest android phone redmi 4a launched in india , price : rs 5,999
apart from these reasons , you can also believe that from march 23 , this phone is going to be available for sale and during this time there may be a lot of waiting for xiaomi redmi 4a while redmi 3s has been available for the last several days . and you can easily buy it .
there was a discussion about moto g5 plus for the last several days and yesterday lenovo unveiled the phone .
this phone is available for sale on online store flipkart .
the most important thing can be said that you do not need to register for this , rather it can be taken in the open cell .
at the same time , the company has also introduced many special offers with the phone .
although a lot is being said about the phone , but there are some drawbacks that can prevent you from taking it .
next we have mentioned 3 major shortcomings .
1 . less memory
the moto g4 plus is available with 16 gb and 32 gb memory .
in such a situation , it was expected that the company will upgrade the moto g5 to the company memory and this time there may not be a phone with 16 gb memory and also available in 64 gb memory .
but in the indian market , this phone has been introduced with 16 gb and 32 gb memory .
in such a situation , it can be said that low memory can disappoint consumers .
because its biggest competitor xiaomi redmi note 4 is available with 64 gb memory at a lower price .
2. more price
most of the phones of the moto g series were available till now at a budget of rs 12,000 , while this time lenovo has introduced the initial model of the moto g5 plus for rs 14,999 .
while the second model is priced at rs 16,999 .
while the 64 gb memory and 4 gb ram variant of xiaomi redmi note 4 is also available for rs 12,000 .
in such a situation , it can be said that this time the phone is quite expensive .

3 . average multimedia
even if you want to feel better multimedia in your phone , the moto g5 plus will not be called better .
because the display of the phone is 5.2-inches this time , meaning it is smaller than the moto g4 plus .
on the other hand , the sound quality also cannot be said to be anything special .
last year , motorola introduced the moto g4 and g4 plus models .
at the same time , reports of its upgraded version moto g5 and moto g5 plus have been coming since the beginning of this year .
the company has today launched the moto g5 plus in india .
in such a situation , consumers will be very curious about what is new in the new phone .
that is , what is more special in moto g5 plus than moto g4 plus .
let us tell you the difference between the two phones .
motorola moto g4 plus has been introduced by the company in a polycarbonate body and the fingerprint sensor has been given in the rear panel itself .
the phone has been nano coated and is also somewhat water and dust inhibitor .

asus zenfone 3 ultra is a large screen phone .
it has a 6.8-inch screen and the screen resolution is full hd ( 1920x1080 pixels ) .
the body of the phone is made of metal and glass , which makes you feel good quality .
the corners of the phone are curved , due to which there is no prick in catching .

the previous panel has a volume button .
the fingerprint sensor is given on the home panel of the phone .
the display of the phone is good and you can use it easily even in the sun .

along with this , there is the adreno 510 gpu which assures you of better graphics .
the phone has 4 gb ram and 64 gb internal memory .
in terms of processor , the phone will be said to be slightly backwards .
if you take a phone of 50 thousand rupees then at least qualco mm 821 chipset will definitely be wanted .
however , there was no significant difference in the initial performance .
there is no problem of heating in this phone .
we used video games and cameras but it did not heat up .
asus zenfone 3 ultra has a 23-megapixel rear camera .
with the camera you will get laser autofocus support .

although earlier it did not have volte support but the company has given an update after which you can make volte calls .
this phone makes you feel of premium quality .
in its rear panel , you will see the antenna band .
as in the old iphone .
lenovo k6 power is also a phone with full metal body and gives you a feel of good quality .
in this also , you will get to see the antenna band in the previous panel .
but in terms of build quality , we cannot say the same as the redmi note 4 .
the screen is laminated but the company has not given information about gorilla glass .
lenovo k6 power gives you a 5-inch full hd screen and its screen resolution is 1920 × 1080 pixels .
in this phone too , the company has not given information about screen protection .
lenovo is small in terms of display but cannot say back .

xiaomi redmi note 4 has been introduced on qualco mm snapdragon 625 chipset .
this phone has a 9 ghz octa-core processor with 2.0 ghz 64 bits .
lenevo k6 power is offered on qualco mm snapdragon 430 chipset and has a 1.4 ghz 64 bits octa-core processor .
both phones are exactly the same here .
lenovo &apos;s processor is a bit old and looks a little weak in terms of strength as well .
xiaomi redmi note 4 and honor 6x have a collision , know which phone is strong
you have been given 64 gb of inbuilt memory with 4 gb ram memory of xiaomi redmi note 4 .
this phone has memory card support .
however the second slot is hybrid and you can use either sim or card .
you will get only 32 gb of internal memory in lenovo k6 power 4 gb ram variant .
this phone also has memory card support , but the second slot is also hybrid .
here too , xiaomi seems to be the winner .
the company has equipped xiaomi redmi note 4 with a 13-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel selfie camera .
lenovo &apos;s 6 power has a 13-megapixel rear camera while the selfie camera is given 8-megapixels .
in this also you will get modes like pdaf and hdr .
lenovo k6 power has a pro feature where you can manually control the camera shutter , iso and aperture etc .
lenovo is ahead in terms of camera features .
the selfie camera is also more powerful .
although the company claims to give it an update .
in k6 power you will get pure ui which is based on android operating system 6.0 marshmallow .
this ui is very similar to stock android .
it has been introduced with dual profile setup where you can run two whatsapp accounts in the same phone .
in this , you will get integration of google play .
in xiaomi redmi note 4 , you have dual sim support and you can take advantage of 4g on both .
for data and connectivity , it will get usb , nfc and 4g volte support .
along with this , usb otg and fingerprint sensor have also been provided .
lenovo k6 power has dual sim support for connectivity and can take advantage of 4g on both slots .
it too has usb otg and fingerprint sensor but no nfc .
however , it does not matter much because nfc is not very used in india .
the xiaomi redmi note 4 has a 4,100 mah battery .
the company has not provided information about talk time .
at the same time , 4,000 mah battery will be available in 6 power .
only slightly different , but lenovo is slightly behind .
lenovo &apos;s 6 power 4 gb ram and 32 gb memory model costs rs 10,999 .
overall , you can see that lenovo k6 power is cheaper by rs 2,000 but by paying a little more money , you are getting a bigger screen , better processor , better design , double memory and bigger battery in xiaomi redmi note 4 .
in such a situation , it can be said that it is better to take xiaomi redmi note 4 .
asus &apos;s zenfone max series is particularly known for its large battery , but in the zenfone 3 max , the company also paid a lot of attention to the look with a large battery .
a few days ago we introduced the trial of zenfone 3 max .
at the same time , another phone came to us today for testing , namely asus zenfone 3s max .
the price of this phone in the indian market is rs 14,999 , but in this budget can it be called a better phone ? in this test , we have tried to know this .
before proceeding on the features of the phone , let &apos;s look at the design .
metal design
today , metal phones are in the trend in the indian market and asus zenfone 3s max has also been kept in the same line .
this phone introduced in mattel unibody is sleek and comes easily in hand .
at the same time , the corner of the phone is curved in the rear panel , because of this the corners do not prick .
comparing it to the old zenfone 3 max , there will be many differences in design .
just like the zenfone 3s max &apos;s rear panel only has an antenna band at the bottom .
while the zenfone 3 max has an antenna design on both the top and bottom .
at the same time , the fingerprint sensor in the asus zenfone 3s max is on the foam button , while in the old phone , the rear panel is given .
its home button is also clickable as seen in samsung phones .
we used the fingerprint sensor several times during use and it was functioning correctly .
it is also very fast there .
the design of the phone is small and you can easily use it with one hand .
you do not have to press the power button to unlock it .
if you have used the fingerprint sensor , you can unlock the screen by clicking the home button .
overall , it can be said that its design will make you feel like a premium phone but we liked the zenfone 3 max launched a few months back .
hd display
the asus zenfone 3s max has a 5.2-inch 2.5d curved display .
the phone &apos;s screen resolution is hd ( 720 × 1280 pixels resolution ) .
its screen is oliya phobic coated which is seen in apple device .
it is scratchproof and also strong .
good but not very good .
hd resolution will be called less in this budget .
we were at least hoping for full hd .
the touch feeling is good there .
you can use this phone easily even in the sun .
processor and ram
asus zenfone 3s max has been introduced on the mediatek mt6750 chipset .
the phone has a 64 bits octa core processor of 1.51 ghz .
along with this is the mali t860 gpu which assures you of better graphics .
at the same time , the performance of the phone is also simple .
in this budget , phones such as xiaomi redmi note 4 and honor 6x are available , which are known for strong performance .
yes , the good thing can be said that despite testing the mantle body , we recorded about half an hour of video during the test and this phone did not heat up at all .
in asus zenfone 3s max , you will get 3 gb ram and 32 gb memory , which can be increased to 128 gb .
asus zenfone 3s max has a 13-megapixel rear camera for photography and an 8-megapixel front camera .
the company introduced it with 5 prism lenses .
talking about camera quality , this time asus was not able to leave its mark .
earlier we have used asus zenfone , whose picture quality was very good , but it seems a little behind those asus phones .
however , there will be a lot of manual control and if you have a good knowledge of shutter speed and aperture , then you can use the phone properly and take better pictures .
at the same time , the option of low light photography has also been given and it is very effective .
it has 12 modes for photography .
most of these modes will also be found with a selfie camera .
like the max series , you will also get a larger battery in the asus zenfone 3s max .
the phone has a 5,000 mh battery .
there is no doubt that the phone &apos;s battery backup is excellent .
once charged the phone , you can use it comfortably for two days .
although many phones are available in this budget with a large battery , but the zenfone 3s max is able to provide power backup for much longer than them .
the company claims 28 hours of talk time and 816 hours of standby time .
at the same time , the company also claims that 10 percent of the battery is capable of up to 28 hours of standby .
at the same time , the zenfone 3s max has reversible charging support .
where you can charge another device with your phone .
apparting system
asus zenfone 3s max has been introduced with the android operating system 7.0 nougat .
it is the latest operating system on android .
however , with this , the zen ui will be seen in the phone .
the phone is easy to use and zen customization is better than before .
in the menu search , you will get the information of recent most used app .
app search and its management in the phone is better .
some apps are preloaded in the phone .
at the same time , with the new os , you can also use options like multiwindows and quick settings customization .
in multiwindows you can run two apps side by side simultaneously , while in quick settings customization you can place your app of choice in quick settings and remove unwanted apps .
for music , the company has also equipped it with 5 magnetizing speakers .
asus zenfone 3s max supports dual sim .
one sim uses microsim while the other one can use nano sim .
it has 3g , wifi and 4g of data .
there will also be 4g volte support .
however , let me tell you that the second slot of this phone is hybrid .
we did not face any problem in internet and connectivity .
asus zenfone 3s max is priced at rs 14,9909 .
if you look at the entire specification and feature of the phone , you will find that the look is good , the battery backup is amazing , the newest operating system and home button are finger print sensor which makes it easy to use .
there are also many features on the fingerprint sensor .
at the same time , the average processor , simple camera and hd screen make the fun of this phone gritty .
so the question is why take this phone .
so let me tell you that this asus phone is available online as well as offline store .
in such a situation , if you compare it with the phone available at the offline store , then it looks equal and it can be said that you can buy this phone .
on the other hand , if you buy the phone from the online store , then xiaomi redmi note 4 and honor 6x will be said to be a better option .
last week xiaomi introduced the redmi note 4 in the indian market .
at the same time , huawei brand honor launched its 6x phone in the indian market this week .
both phones are considered very powerful and consumers also want to know about them .
in such a situation , we have compared huawei and honor 6x so that you can know which phone is better .
the body of xiaomi redmi note 4 is made of metal and will make you feel great .
the antenna band is in the rear panel of the phone .
it is good in built and quality .
honor 6x also has a metal body and corners are quite a curve .
it feels comfortable to hold .
although both the phones are excellent but in terms of design , we liked honor 6x much better .

if you are planning to buy this phone , then you can read this small review first .
let &apos;s start with the phone &apos;s dual camera .
the back panel of this phone has a dual rear camera which is slightly protruding from the body .
however , the company did not say whether it was a sapphire glass or not .
in such a situation there will be a risk of scratch .
earlier , the company introduced honor 8 with dual cameras .
however , where both cameras were 8 megapixels in honor 8 .
at the same time , honor 6x has a 12-megapixel , while the other has been given 2-megapixels .
functionality with the camera will be the same as in honor 8 .
you will get features like background blur , monochrome and quick focus .
the camera quality of the phone is superb and you can use the bokeh effect from a bottle .
that is , you can blur the background and clean it .
now let &apos;s talk about design .
seeing the design of honor 6x , your heart will come on it .
at the same time , when this phone comes in your hand , you may also make up your mind to buy it .
overall it can be said that it is very stylish to look at and will also make you feel premium .

the rear panel will get a fingerprint scanner and there is no button on the main panel .
the buttons will appear after the screen is on .
in the unibody design , you will see a sim slot in the right panel in this phone .
the second slot in this dual sim based phone is hybrid .
where you will be able to use only one of the sims and cards .
at the same time , nano sim is used in both slots .
the phone uses 2.5d curved glass which gives it strength .
the display of the phone is good but cannot say very good .
this phone is available in two models with 3 gb ram and 32 gb memory and 4 gb ram and 64 gb memory option .
we used a model with 3 gb ram and there was no shortage of any kind in the phone .
as far as performance is concerned , in some tests it has been slightly behind qualco mm snapdragon 625 but is able to handle your daily tasks .
not only this , it was also capable of playing heavy games .

recently , hmd global has launched the nokia 6 smartphone in china .
during its first cell in china , this phone soldered out within a minute .
global variant of this phone is also reported to be launched in february and this model is expected to come in india as well .
at the same time , xiaomi has launched the redmi note 4 in india .
this phone is also considered to be very powerful .
now the question is whether consumers should take xiaomi redmi 4 .
nokia &apos;s most popular brand of nokia phones should wait .
next we have compared tulna based on the specification and feature of both phones and you can see the result .
hmd global has claimed that the best technology has been used to make nokia 6 .
it took about 55 minutes to make each phone .
its body is made of 6000 series aluminum .
it is worth noting that 6000 series aluminum body is used in apple iphone .
like the iphone 7 , it also has an antenna band below and above the phone .
in such a situation , you can say that the build quality of nokia 6 is excellent .
at the same time , the body of xiaomi redmi note 4 is also made of metal and will make you feel great .
it has an antenna band in the rear of the phone .
it is also good in built and quality .
however , it does not have the quality of iphone which is in nokia 6 .
in such a situation , nokia can go a little further .
nokia 6 has a 5.5-inch full hd screen .
the company has used 2.5d curved glass , while corning gorilla glass 3 is coated .
apart from this , a polarized layer has been used on the screen .
with this you can get a clear view even in strong sunlight .
the xiaomi redmi note 4 features a 5.5-inch 2.5d curved glass full hd display .
although the company has said that the screen is laminated but has not given information about gorilla glass .
at the same time , dhoom has not mentioned any special technique for display .
in such a situation , nokia wins the game here too .
asus launches 5,000 mah battery and dual camera phone zenfone 3 zoom , see its glimpse
nokia 6 has been introduced on qualco mm snapdragon 430 chipset .
a 64 bits 8x octa-core processor with 1.4 ghz clock speed has been given .
along with this , adreno 505 gpu will be available .
in this segment , xiaomi redmi note 4 proves to be far better .
its processor is very good .
nokia 6 has 4 gb ram memory .
along with this , 64 gb internal memory has been given .
it has microsd card support up to 128 gb .
xiaomi redmi note 4 is available with 2 gb , 3 gb and 4 gb ram memory .
where you will get 32 ​ ​ gb of storage with 2 gb and 3 gb ram memory .
in this you can not tell anyone further .
for photography , the nokia 6 has a 16-megapixel rear camera while the secondary camera is given 8-megapixels .
the phone has pdaf support .
xiaomi redmi note 4 has a 13-megapixel rear camera .
in such a situation , you can understand that nokia is one way ahead in terms of picture .
because megapixels are also better and the company is better known in photography right from the start .
nekia 6 runs on android operating system 7.0 , which is the newest operating system on android .
along with this , it has dolby atmos integration for better music .
although the company has claimed to give it an update , but it is still behind nokia 6 .
there is nothing special for music as well .
ten phones have dual sim support and you can use 4g lte in both .
capable of supporting almost all bands of 4g .
it has otg support with usb .
at the same time , fingerprint sensor has been given in nokia 6 for security .
the company has not provided information about talktai .
however the note 4 is ahead in terms of battery .
but remember that nokia phones are always known for low battery consumption .
nokia is not currently available in india .
but it is expected that it will be available in the budget of rs 16,000 .
if seen , xiaomi redmi note 4 is ahead in terms of processor and battery .
nokia &apos;s style , camera and processor are better .
on this basis , it can be said that xiaomi is ahead in terms of performance , but if you want to get a phone with the best camera , then nokia is difficult to match .
at the same time , indian consumers who always say nokia is nokia , this factor also outpaces nokia 6 .

it has a 1.95 ghz octa-core processor .
lenovo has introduced the p2 model in the indian market today .
a few days ago , the company launched moto m.
both phones are equipped with excellent specifications and are available in almost the same budget .
in such a situation , the big question for consumers is which phone is better for them .
even though lenovo and moto belong to the same company , but consumers know them as different brands and the company itself still keeps them separate .
so let &apos;s see which phone is better in lenovo p2 and moto m.
lenovo p2 launched with 4 gb ram and 5,100 mah battery , know everything about this phone
the moto m is the company &apos;s first metal designed phone .
the body of the phone has a slight curve from the back which makes it comfortable to hold .
at the same time , its look is slightly different from other android phones which brings newness to it .
the body of the moto m has been coated with p2i nano , which is capable of protecting it from water and dust to some extent .
the thickness of this phone is only 7.9  mm and due to this it looks quite slim .
lenovo p2 has also been introduced by the company with a full metal body .
however , the home button of the phone is very much like a samsung device .
the corners of this phone also have some curves and due to this it is also enjoyable to hold .
although the company has tried to give it a new look but it still leaves the impression of lenovo brand .
look is good but we liked moto more .
it does not have a nano coating , so it can be said a little back .
the motorola moto m has a 5.5-inch full hd 2.5d curved display .
the lenovo p2 smartphone is a 5.5-inch full hd display .
the phone &apos;s screen resolution is 1920 x 1080 pixels .
at the same time , the company has used the super amoled screen , which can be said to be much better than moto .
in such a situation , you can say that p2 is much better for display .
the moto m has been introduced on mediatek &apos;s helio p15 chipset .
this phone has a 64 bits octa core processor with 2.2 ghz clock speed .
with this , the mali-t860 gpu will be seen .
lenovo p2 company has introduced qualco mm snapdragon 625 chipset .
in addition , the phone has a 2.0 ghz octa-core processor .
the phone has adreno 506 gpu .
though moto is ahead in terms of clock speed , but qualco mm chipset is said to be more reliable .
in this case , according to me lenovo will be called better .
ram and rom
motorola moto m has been introduced with 3 gb ram and 4 gb ram .
the model with 3 gb ram has 32 gb internal memory and 64 gb internal memory with 4 gb ram .
both models have card support and you can use memory cards up to 256 gb .
lenovo p2 has also been introduced in 3 gb ram and 4 gb ram variants .
along with this , there is 32 gb internal memory .
it has memory card support up to 128 gb .
however , one cannot be called forward or backward here .
the moto m also has a 16-megapixel rear and 8-megapixel selfie camera .
with the rear camera , you will get to see features like dual tone led flash and pdaf .
it has full hd video record support .
lenovo p2 has a 13-megapixel rear camera with led flash .
along with this , the phone has a 5-megapixel front camera .
features like pdaf will be available but it has hd video record support , not full hd .
in terms of camera , the lenovo p2 is lower than the moto m.
not only is the megapixel less but the functionality is also minor .
both lenovo p2 and motorola moto m phones work on android operating system 6.0 marshmallow .
although there may be a slight difference in the ui , lenovo has a pure ui and moto has stock android .
but both phones are almost the same .
the moto m has a 3,050 mah battery .
it has fast charging support .
for power backup , lenovo p2 has a large battery of 5,100 mah .
the company has claimed 32 days of standby time and 78.69 hours of talk time .
at the same time , it is also able to support fast charging .
p2 is far ahead of moto m here .
both phones have dual sim support and you can take advantage of 4g volte with 3g , wifi .
along with this , fingerprint sensor will also be available .
however , the fingerprint sensor on the moto is in the rear panel , while in lenovo on the home panel .
samsung will introduce three new smartphones in its &apos; c &apos; series
the phone with moto m 3gb ram is priced at rs 15,999 .
while the phone with 4 gb ram and 64 gb memory is available for rs 17,999 .
the price of lenovo p2 3gb ram model is rs 16,999 .
at the same time , the company has 4 gb ram model available for rs 17,999 .
keep these 8 things in mind before purchasing a perfect selfie phone
if we look at all the segments , you will find that the moto m is good in design and camera .
at the same time , we would call lenovo p2 better in terms of battery , display and processor .
overall , both phones are almost equal but my opinion goes to lenovo .
qualco mm processor and super amoled display make the phone special .
asus launched two phones during the ongoing ces 2017 consumer electronics show in las vegas .

cool 1 dual , the first phone designed by coolpad and leeco , has been launched in india .
the specification , price and features of the phone are excellent .
but in this budget phones like motorola moto m and lenovo k6 note are already available which have the power to compete with it .
so will the coolpad cool 1 dual overcome their challenge ? let &apos;s know .
coolpad cool 1 will not be called new in terms of dual design .
this phone is very similar to leeco le2 .
however the quality of the phone is better and will also make you feel good .
the moto m is the company &apos;s first metal phone .
its body is the back curve and in terms of look , it also has newness .
lenevo k6 note is also a phone made in full metal design .
its look is good but looking at it you cannot say that there is newness in the look .
even before this , we have seen lenovo phones in this design .
although you will not call anyone less in terms of design , but moto m we liked .
the coolpad cool 1 dual has a 5.5-inch full hd display .
however , the company has not given any information about the coating .
the motorola moto m also has a 5.5-inch full hd 2.5d curved display .
in this case , there is no significant difference in the screen .
lenovo k6 note also has a 5.5-inch full hd ips lcd screen .
it can be said that you will get similar displays in all three phones .

along with this , there is an adreno 510 gpu for better graphics .
this phone has a 64 bits octa core processor with 2.2 ghz clock speed .
lenovo k6 note has been introduced on qualco mm snapdragon 430 chipset and this phone has a 1.4 ghz 64 bits octa-core processor .
along with this , adreno 505 gpu will be seen .
it appears to be the weakest lenovo k6 note .
coolpad cool 1 dual has 3 gb ram and 4 gb ram memory available .
it has 32 gb storage .
however , the drawback can be said that the phone does not have card support .
motorola moto m 3 gb ram + 32 gb memory and 4 gb ram + 64 gb internal memory has been given .
both models have memory card support up to 256 gb .
lenovo k6 note is available with 3 gb ram and 4 gb ram memory .
with both ram memory , you will get 32 ​ ​ gb internal memory .
it has memory card support .
the weakest coolpad appears here .
coolpad cool 1 dual 13-megapixel two rear cameras are provided .
one camera is rgb while the other lens takes photos with monochrome .
with this , you will not only be able to edit photos in a better way , but the details in photography will also be much better .
it also has an 8-megapixel secondary camera .
the moto m has a 16-megapixel rear and 8-megapixel selfie camera .
lenovo &apos;s 6 note has a 16-megapixel rear camera with led flash and an 8-megapixel front camera with a selfie .

the phone has fast charging support .
the moto has a 3,050 mah battery .
lenovo has a 4,000 mah power battery for power backup .
coolpad has dual sim support and you can take advantage of 4g in both sims .

it also has a fingerprint sensor .
however , its second slot is hybrid .
where you can use only one of the sims and cards .
lenovo k6 note also has similar feature .
fingerprint sensor has been given and it also has 4g support .
there is also a second sim slot hybrid where you can use only one of the sims and cards .
the coolpad cool 1 dual is priced at rs 13,999 .
the moto m 3gb ram phone is priced at rs 15,999 while the 4gb ram phone is available for rs 17,999 .
lenovo k6 note 3 gb ram phone is available for rs 13,999 and 4 gb ram phone is available for rs 15,499 .
overall , the coolpad cool 1 dual is overwhelming everywhere .
coolpad cool 1 dual appears at the forefront due to low price , more ram , better processor , powerful dual camera and usb type c.
but the only drawback is that there is no card support .
but it is also worth noting that if you use the memory card in moto m and lenovo k6 note , then you cannot use another sim .
if you put a sim on it , then there is no card .
seeing all the features , my opinion goes to the cool 1 dual and it will be called a better phone .
mukesh ambani &apos;s company reliance digital has launched a new phone in the indian market today .
the company has launched life f1s .
the specifications and features of the phone are very beautiful and in the budget of rs 10,000 it will be called one of the best phones .
however , in this budget , this phone of life has a direct competition with xiaomi redmi note 3 , which has been the first choice of consumers for the last several months .
so is this phone of life better than redmi note 3 .
next we have tested both phones in every segment .
and you can see the result yourself .
the life f1s smartphone has a 5.2-inch full hd screen .
its screen is gorilla glass 4 coated which not only protects from scratches but also gives strength to the screen .
xiaomi redmi note 3 has been introduced with full metal body .
it has a 5.5-inch sunlight display .
the screen resolution of the phone is 1920 × 1080 pixels and a special type of coating has been done to protect it from scratch .
although the company has not given the name of the coating .
but the display is better .
although the screen of life f1s is small , but it has used corning gorilla glass which is very good .
this protects the screen from scratch and also provides strength .
the life f1s has been introduced on a qualco mm snapdragon 652 chipset and has a 1.8 ghz 64 bits octa-core processor .
along with this , 3 gb ram memory is available .
adreno 510 gpu has been given for better graphics .
the redmi note 3 has been introduced on the qualco mm snapdragon 650 chipset .
the phone has a 64 ghz hexacore processor of 1.8 ghz .
this qualco mm processor is quite advanced and is also available in many expensive phones .
although the life f1s overtakes right here by a slight margin .
in the life f1s smartphone , you have been given 32 gb of internal memory .
along with this there is expandable storage .
you can use cards up to 128 gb .
redmi note 3 has been introduced in the indian market with 16 gb and 32 gb internal memory .
the model with 16 gb memory has 2 gb ram and 3 gb ram memory with 32 gb internal memory .
the phone has microsd card support .
in such a situation , the life f1s from the 16 gb memory will be called ahead .
for photography , the life f1s has a 16-megapixel rear camera , which is equipped with autofocus and dual led flash .
this phone is capable of recording 4k videos .
for video , this phone is capable of recording hd quality video .
for the selfie , you will get a 5-megapixel front camera .
this front flash has been provided for better selfie in low light .
xiaomi redmi note 3 has a 16-megapixel rear camera .
a 5-megapixel front camera is available for the selfie .
the company has equipped it with pdaf autofocus technology .
there will be no front flash in it .
this dual sim based phone has wifi , bluetooth and usb otg support with lte + .
at the same time , you will get usb type c which is known for fast data transfer and fast charging .
this dual sim based phone has a slot hybrid where you can use only one of the sims or cards .
you will not get a fingerprint sensor in the phone .
xiaomi reoomi note 3 also has dual sim support and also has hybrid sim support .
at the same time , with 4g lte for data , you will get wifi , bluetooth and usb .
it has usb otg but you will not get type c.
however , fingerprint sensor has been given in it for security .
in such a situation , it can be said that life is a little behind , but let me say that it has lte + with usb type c , then it will give you better speed than an ordinary 4g phone and gives assurance of better speed even in low network area .
for power backup , the life f1s has a 3,000 mah battery .
this phone has fast charging support .
at the same time , 4,050 mah battery has been given in xiaomi redmi note 3 and the company has claimed fast charging .
it can be said that xiaomi is ahead .
life f1s is priced at rs 9,599 and can be purchased from online store aegeo and reliance digital .
there are two variants of xiaomi redmi note 3 priced at rs 9,999 ; 2 gb ram + 16 gb memory and rs 11,999 ; 3 gb ram + 32 gb memory .
you can get it from online store flipkart .
overall , it can be said that in the segment of less than rs 10,000 , life f1s falls on xiaomi redmi note 3 .
it has 3 gb ram memory and 32 gb internal memory with better processor , whereas xiaomi &apos;s 2 gb ram phone is available in this budget .
not only this , life is also better for 4g connectivity .
in the case of battery and fingerprint sensor , only the redmi note 3 leads .
however my vote goes to life f1s which is also available in offline .
in the past week , karbonn has introduced four 4g phones at a lower price .
all phones are available in the budget of rs 5,000 to rs 6,500 .
the lowest priced phone among these is karbonn k9 smart 4g .
the price of this phone is rs 5,090 .
at the same time , in the same budget , the leading indian mobile phone manufacturer micromax has also introduced its 4g volte phone .
this phone also has a budget of about 5,000 rupees .
in such a situation , there is a direct fight between micromax , india &apos;s second largest mobile company and karbonn , the third largest mobile manufacturer .
every consumer would like to know whether karbonn k9 smart 4g is better or micromax video 2 .
next we have taken the competition of both phones and have given our conclusion .
karbonn k9 smart 4g is a low budget phone but better looking .
the body of the phone is made of metal and mattefinish polycarbonate .
it has a slight curve from the back that makes it smart .
due to the curve , its thickness is up to 10  mm , but the corners are quite thin , so it looks slim .
on the other hand , the company has introduced it in metal finish when it comes to micromax video 2 .
the main panel of the phone will get glass while the rear panel is of plastic and metal .
by giving the mantle , the company has tried to give it a premium look but it can be said that it has not been successful .
video 2 is thicker and slightly heavier .
in this case , karbonn k9 smart 4g will be called better in terms of design .
asus zenfone 3 max review : stylish look , great battery but slight lack
karbonn k9 smart 4g has a 5-inch tft fwvga screen .
the screen resolution of the phone is 480 x 854 pixels .
at the same time , the company has not given any information about the protection .
speaking of micromax video 2 , this phone has a 4.5-inch fwvga screen .
its screen resolution is 480 × 854 pixels .
however , while the screen ratio in k9 smart 4g is 196 ppi , video 2 has 218 ppi .
in this case , video 2 will give you a slightly sharper display but the phone &apos;s screen is smaller .
in this case too , you would call karbonn k9 smart 4g better .
processor , ram and rom
k9 smart 4g has been introduced on the mediatek chipset and has a 1.2 ghz quadcore processor .
along with this , there is 1 gb ram and 8 gb internal memory .
card support has been provided in the phone .
in micromax video 2 , you will also get a 1.3 ghz quadcore processor along with 1 gb ram and 8 gb internal memory .
it has card support up to 32 gb .
here you can not say anything to anyone .
know which phone is better in xiaomi redmi note 3 and nubia n1
this karbonn phone works on the indus operating system .
this android operating system is 6.0 marshmallow based but has given many customizations keeping in mind the indian consumers .
there will also be support for regional languages .
in this , you will get options like text to speech , free indent message and gender for file transfer .
at the same time , video 2 android operating system 6.0 is marshmallow based .
in this , you will get the google doo application preloaded so that you can make video calls .
however this is not a very big feature .
you can also download this app from google play store for free on any android phone .
in such a situation , even with a slight difference , only the phone of carbon is defeated .
karbonn k9 smart 4g has a 5-megapixel front and 5-megapixel main camera for photography .
at the same time , the main camera in micromax video 2 is 5-megapixels while the secondary camera is 2-megapixels .
in this case , k9 smart phone will be called good in terms of camera as well .
dual sim based k9 smarter 4g has 4g volte support for connectivity .
in this , you can use reliance &apos;s 4g sim .
there will also be wifi , 3g and gps .
video 2 has 4g volte support and the company is also offering free live sim with it .
it also has dual sim support and you can use 3g , wifi and gps with 4g .
for power backup , a 2,300 mah battery has been given in karbonn k9 smart 4g .
while the micromax video 2 has a 1,600 mah battery .
here too micromax is seen behind .
there is not a single segment where micromax is said to be better .
karbonn k9 smart 4g proves to be better in every segment .
in such a situation , if the budget is rs 5,000 , then it is better not to take micromax video 2 .
karbonn k9 smart 4g is a better option .
even though asus started with computers and laptops , today the company also has a good identity in the smartphone market .
in the last few years , the company has launched many phones in its zenfone series , including zenfone 5 to the world &apos;s first 4 gb ram phone zenfone 2 .
although till now the company was available only through online store , but from this year asus phones can be purchased from offline store as well .
recently , the company has launched several phones which are available both online and offline .
one of these phones is asus zenfone 3 max .
as you know , the asus zenfone max series is particularly known for large batteries .
this is also the case in this phone .
but asus zenfone 3 max is different from all max phones launched so far .
because this phone with big battery is also rich in style and features .
this phone was also available to us for review and we used it for about 15 days .
during use , we found many things good and some deficiencies were also shown which are given further .
let me tell you that there are two versions of asus zenfone max one phone is available with 5.2 inch screen while the other one is with 5.5-inch screen .
we have zenfone 3 max 5.5 available .
max style
in zenfone 3 series , asus has changed the design significantly .
the company &apos;s phones have become smarter than before .
asus zenfone 3 max 5.5 also has the power to attract you in its first glimpse .
in the rear panel of the phone , you can see the antenna design which was earlier seen in apple &apos;s phone .
there are some curves of the phone which do not prick in the hand when holding the phone .
fingerprint sensor will be seen in the rear panel of the phone .
in the use of the phone , we used the fingerprint sensor several times and it was working correctly .
despite a large battery , it weighs just 175 grams .
in such a situation , you cannot call it too heavy .
overall , it can be said that its design will make you feel like a premium phone .
asus zenfone 3 max 5.5 also has a 5.5-inch 2.5d curved display .
we tested it by all means while using the phone .
the display is brighter and better .
at the same time , the touch feeling is also good .
lenovo k6 power vs xiaomi , who is the king of budget phone
after good looks and great display , we were also wishing for a great processor in asus zenfone max but here you may have to compromise a bit .
the company has introduced it on qualco mm snapdragon 430 chipset .
the phone has a 1.4 ghz 64 bits octa core processor .
these chipsets are also available in some low-priced phones .
in this case , the phone will be said to be slightly behind in terms of processor .
however , during the review , we ran several games and apps with browsing on it and did not see any problem .
at the same time , where there is a complaint of heating in the metal phone , we did not find anything like this in the phone .
but even if there was a qualco mm snapdragon 652 chipset at this price , it would have been called much better .
in asus zenfone 3 max 5.5 , you will get 3 gb ram and 32 gb memory , which can be increased to 128 gb .
asus zenfone 3 max 5.5 has a 16-megapixel rear camera for photography and an 8-megapixel front camera .
the company introduced it with 5 prism lenses and is also equipped with a laser autofocus feature .
asus claims that it is capable of focusing in just 0.03 seconds .
at the same time , with the front camera , you will get to see some special features .
if we talk about camera quality then we can say good but not very good .
earlier we have used asus zenfone , whose picture quality can be said to be very good .
but in that case , this phone proves to be a little dull .
however , you will get a lot of manual control and if you have a good knowledge of shutter speed and aperture , then you can use the phone properly .
asus zenfone 3 max 5.5 has been introduced with android operating system 6.0 marshmallow .
with this , you will get to see genui 3.0 .
although the customization has been better than before but we like the plane android more .
however , it is not that you do not like it .
in this , app search and its management is more good .
some apps are preloaded in the phone but you will not call them very useful .
asus zenfone 3 max supports dual sim and it has 3g , wifi and 4g for data .
fingerprint sensor will also be found in the rear panel for security .
where you can use either sim or memory card .
today , this is being seen in most expensive dual sim phones .
this phone has a 4,100 mh battery .
the company claims 20 hours of talk time and 38 days of standby time .
during the review of the phone , we did not get any complaint from the battery .
although 4,000 mah battery is common today , it cannot be called very much but once charging the phone , you can easily remove it from one and a half to two days .
the good thing can be said that asus zenfone 3 max 5.5 has reverse charging support with fast charging where you can also use the phone as a power bank .
asus zenfone 3 max 5.5 is priced at rs 17,990 .
if you look at the entire specification and feature of the phone , you will find that the look is smart , the display is great , the operating system can not be said too old , the processor is average , memory and ram is not lacking .
at the same time , the camera is also not very good or not bad .
perfect for your daily use .
so the question is whether to buy it or not .
so let me tell you that in this budget , if you compare it with the phone available online , then the phone like moto m , lenovo k6 note and leeco le 2 max is a little behind .
yes , if you are shopping from offline retail , then it will be counted as one of the best phones .
there , this phone can get a tough competition from samsung galaxy j7 prime .
lenovo has launched two phones this week .
one phone has been introduced under lenovo brand while the other phone has been launched under moto brand .
although both phones are of almost the same budget , there is a big question for the general consumer as to which phone to take .
because both lenovo and moto brands are quite popular in india .
next we have compared the features and specifications from both phones , from where you can choose a better phone .
lenevo &apos;s 6 note is a phone made in metal design .
the look of the phone is good but looking at it , you cannot say that there is newness in the look .
the moto m is the company &apos;s first metal-designed phone and has a slightly curved back body that makes it comfortable to hold .
there is also newness in the look .
this feature is not in lenovo k6 note .
lenovo k6 note has a 5.5-inch full hd ips lcd screen .
moto is far ahead in terms of processing .
that is to say , more powerful .
speaking of photography , lenovo k6 power has a 16-megapixel rear camera with dual led flash and an 8-megapixel front camera of selfie .
the camera is equipped with pdaf technology for fast focus .
with the rear camera , you will get to see features like dual tone led flash and pdaf .
there is no difference between the cameras of both phones .
both lenovo k6 note and motorola moto m phones work on android operating system 6.0 marshmallow .
lenovo &apos;s 6 note 3 gb ram model has an initial price of rs 13,999 .
at the same time , the company has not told about the 4 gb ram model .
but it is expected to be up to rs 15,999 .
now the question is which model is better , then the 4 gb phone of lenovo k6 note is coming in the model with 3 gb ram of moto .
lenovo is also ahead in battery .
but then my vote goes to moto .
because powerful processors , usb type c , new look and stock make the use of android phones great .
chinese smartphone manufacturer nubia has introduced the n1 model in india .
this mid-range phone is equipped with a very cool feature .
but there is a phone in this budget which has been holding its own for more than 6 months .
we are talking about the xiaomi redmi note 3 .
many phones were launched in a budget of less than rs 12,000 , but no one could match it .
there is a question as to whether the nubia n1 is able to compete with the xiaomi redmi note 3 .
or , like other brands of phones , the n1 will remain as an alternative to the note 3 .
next we have tested both phones in every segment and have given our clear decision .
first of all talk about the design , then xiaomi redmi note 3 has tried to give a premium look .
the company has introduced it with a full metal body .
it is not very heavy , despite a large screen and large battery .
this phone of metal design is slim to watch and its thickness is only 8.7  mm .
overall , in the case of the look , you will not find any mi in the note .
as far as nubia n1 is concerned , the body of this phone is also made of metal and is good in terms of look .
but it can not be called better than the redmi note 3 .
the thickness of this phone is 8.9  mm and the weight is also higher than the nubia n1 .
in this phone too , the fingerprint sensor will appear in the rear panel .
in such a situation , it can be said that xiaomi redmi note 3 is far better in terms of look .
lenovo k6 power vs xiaomi redmi 3s prime , know who is the king of budget phones
the xiaomi redmi note 3 features a 5.5-inch sunlight display .
the screen resolution of the phone is 1920 × 1280 pixels and a special type of coating has been done to protect it from scratch .
however , the company has not given the name of kotink .
talking about nubia n1 , you will also get a 5.5-inch full hd screen in this phone .
the phone &apos;s screen resolution is 1920 × 1280 pixels and the phone uses 2.5d curved glass .
in such a situation , it can be said that no one can be called forward or backward in the display .
great processor
this qualco mm processor is very advanced and is also available in many expensive phones .
the nubia n1 runs on the mediatek helio p10 chipset and has a 1.8 ghz octa-core processor .
along with this is the mali t860 gpu .
this phone is also not less in terms of processor .
give you the assurance of excellent performance .
at the same time , the n1 has been provided with the power of 3 gb ram .
along with this , 32 gb internal memory has been given .

you have microsd card support up to 128 gb .
xiaomi redmi note 3 has a 16-megapixel rear camera .
the company claims that it is capable of focusing in 0.1 seconds for photography .
in terms of camera too , nubia looks much better than redmi note 3 .
it has a 13-megapixel front and back camera , both front and back .
nubia proves to be much better than xiaomi in terms of selfie camera .
the xiaomi redmi note 3 has a 4,050 mah battery and the company has claimed fast charging .
at the same time , nubia n11 has a battery of 5,000 mah .
nubia is also ahead in terms of battery .
there are two variants of xiaomi redmi note 3 , which are priced at rs 9,999 and rs 11,999 .
nubia n can also be taken for rs 11,999 .
if you look at all the specifications and features of both phones , then you will find that both phones are almost equal .
yes , xiaomi redmi note 3 is ahead in terms of look but nubia proves to be better in camera and battery .
if you are a selfie fan , then nubia n1 will be called the best .
the leading chinese smartphone manufacturer nubia has launched two phones simultaneously in the indian market today .
the company has introduced nubia z11 and nubia n1 .
there was a lot of discussion about the nubia z11 for the last few days .
this phone has 6 gb ram memory .
while the nubia z11 is priced at rs 29,999 , the nubia n1 can be taken for rs 11,999 .
in the indian market , these phones can be taken exclusively from the online store amazon store .

lenovo has introduced the k6 power smartphone in the indian market with a large battery and powerful features .
this phone is available with the online store flipkart and is priced at rs 9,999 .
according to the budget , the phone can be said to be good but there is a phone which is available with almost the same specification and has the power to give it a tough competition .
that phone is xiaomi redmi 3s prime .
which the company has launched in india a few months ago .
at the same time , it can be said that this phone is also available in a budget of less than rs 1,000 .
in such a situation , there is a big question for the consumer that which phone is better for them ? so let &apos;s test both phones in every segment .
whenever mentioning of low range smartphones comes into our mind , a phone with polycarbonate body comes to mind .
but the xiaomi redmi 3s prime is the most different .
the body of the phone is made of metal and the metal is available in unibody design .
this phone is very stylish to watch .
its vajap is 144 grams and thickness is 8.5  mm .
it is a good phone in terms of overall taste design .
lenovo k6 power is also no less in terms of design .
this phone is also available with a unibody design in metal finish .
in this , the use of breast metal makes it feel better to hold the phone .
the weight of this phone is 145 grams and thickness is 9.3  mm .
the design of the phone is good but it is about one  mm thicker than the redmi 3s prime .
in this case , xiaomi will be called better in terms of design .
the company has informed that the phone screen is laminated which protects it from scratch but it is not gorilla glass coated .
here lenovo wins the game .
the phone has a 5-inch full hd screen and its screen resolution is 1920 × 1080 pixels .
while xiaomi has hd screen only .
although the screen of the 6 power k is not gorilla glass coated but it is also laminated which protects you from rubbing .
xiaomi redmi 3s prime has been introduced on qualco mm snapdragon 430 chipset .
the phone has a 64 bits octa core processor with 1.4 ghz clock speed .
this is the first phone to be launched in india .
which has been introduced on qualco mm &apos;s 430 chipset .
lenevo k6 power also runs on qualco mm snapdragon 430 octacore processor .
the phone has a 64 ghz octa core processor of 1.4 ghz .
xiaomi redmi 3s prime has 3 gb ram memory with 32 gb internal memory .
it has memory card support and you can use a microsd card up to 128 gb .
at the same time , lenovo is also available with 3 gb ram and 32 gb internal memory .
this phone also has memory card support .
for photography , the 13-megapixel main camera has been given in xiaomi redmi 3s .
there is a 5-megapixel secondary camera available .
it has been equipped with pdaf technology for faster autofocus .
the company claims that it is capable of focusing in just 0.1 seconds .
lenovo k6 power has a 13-megapixel rear camera with led flash .
there is an 8-megapixel front camera available .
the phone has features like pdaf , while in this you will get the pro feature , where you can manually control the iso and aperture etc. of the camera .
here too , lenovo wins the game .
the front camera is better and the features are also slightly advanced .
in lenovo , you will get pure ui which is based on android operating system 6.0 marshmallow .
at the same time , the company has introduced it with a dual profile setup where you can run two whatsapp accounts in the same phone .
however , the second slot is hybrid and you will be able to use either a memory card or one of the sims .
one slot in the phone can use micro sim card while the other slot is for nano sim card .
in addition to wifi , 3g and bluetooth , 4g support will also be available .
in the phone , you can take advantage of 4g on both sims .
at the same time , it can be said that it also has volte support , where you can call for free from jio sim .
connectivity in lenovo k6 power is quite similar in this case .
this dual sim based phone has a slot hybrid where only one of the sims or cards can be used .
in the phone , you can take advantage of 4g on both slots .
this phone also has volte support where you can use jio sim .
finger print sensor
fingerprint sensor has been given in xiaomi redmi prime and through this you can not only lock the phone but can also take a selfie .
not only this , you can also lock the app .
you will also get lenovo k6 power fingerprint sensor and it can also be used for app lock and selfie in addition to phone lock .
other features
lenovo k6 power has some special features that need to be mentioned .
the phone has dual dolby atmos speakers inbuilt which are known for better music .
at the same time , you will get an option like theter max in the phone , which can convert any multimedia content to vr .
price and availability : the xiaomi redmi 3s is available for sale on prime me.com and flipkart where the phone costs rs 8,999 .
lenovo k6 power is priced at rs 9,999 and this phone will be available for sale on flipkart from 6 december .
if you compare both phones in all segments , you will find that there are equal everywhere .
with a slight difference in style and battery , the xiaomi redmi 3s prime overtakes , and lenovo bets on the display , selfie camera and music .
in such a situation , if you want to pay more than rs 1,000 for full hd display , takwar selfie camera and music , then lenovo is better .
otherwise , redmi 3s prime can also be said to be better in price .
in the last few years , the trend of smart tv has increased coffee .
people want to have a sleek and stylized tv instead of a bulky and 40-inch crt screen tv .
which can be easily hung or placed in the room or in the drawing room .
the smartness of the tv is not only big but the display and connectivity has also become better than before .
kodak has recently introduced a similar model in the smart tv segment .
the company has introduced smart tvs in 32-inch , 40-inch and 50-inch screens .
out of these , the kodak 50 fhdx smart model tv with 50-inch screen was available to us for review , which we tested in every way and its conclusion is before you .
the kodak 50 fhdx is available in a smart slim design where a one-inch bezel will be seen on the side of the screen .
there will be no significant innovation in terms of design .
there is a flat design and the light for power in the right-hand corner and the kodak logo in the middle .
yes , if you keep it , with the stand you need almost a fit .
the weight of this tv is 15.85 kilograms which cannot be said much .
talking about the display , the screen resolution of this tv with 50-inch aed display is 1920 × 1080 pixels .
it supports 16.7 million display colors and you can get a clear view from 178 angles .
the aspect ratio of this tv is 16 : 9 which is seen in the new standard format of the tv .
the contrast ratio is 4000 : 1 and the response time is 8 milli-seconds .
overall the display specifications are good but the performance is average .
during the review , we did not get any complaints from the picture quality .
the performance of the graphics and colors was excellent but there was a slight decrease in the video .
it was playing high definition fullhd video but was unable to play 4k video .
at the same time , while playing high quality video , it was a little behind from the smoothness which we were hoping for .
perhaps the reason for this is that the refresh rate of this tv is not 60 hz , which can be called a very important feature in terms of a smart tv and when we are talking about a big screen size tv it is even more important because pictures are displayed very clearly in this .
after display , the kodak 50 fhdx smart comes with two 10 watt built-in speakers .
for audio , it supports aac , mp3 , wave and wma formats .
it has a 5 band equalizer setting .
during the review , we found that a slim led tv had much more than the volume label .
as we already talked about this is a smart tv .
it has android operating system 4.4 kitkat support .
although this operating system is a bit old , but generally smart tv has the same support now .
in this you can use many features including facebook and browsing .
kodak 50 fhdx smart will also have 3 hdmi ports , 3 usb ports , 1 headphone , 1 pc and wifi for connectivity .
at the same time , it also has ethernet connectivity .
tv remort is also equipped with smart control .
kodak tvs are available only in online stores in india .
as far as the kodak 50 fhdx smart is concerned , it costs around rs 35,000 .
in this budget , the kodak 50 fhdx smart can be called a good deal .
good display , shandar chound , slim design , better connectivity and smart features are its specialty .
very few smart tvs with 50-inch screens are available in this budget .
although 4k support and refresh rate would have been 60 hz support , it would have been better .
in this budget , this 50-inch tv from kodak is expected to get a tough competition from the vu h50 311 .
after discussion of last several days , oneplus 3t smartphone was launched in us and it is expected to come to india soon .
as already discussed , this phone is an upgraded version of the old oneplus 3 and it is so .
but the question for the consumer is that which phone is more better than oneplus 3 and oneplus 3t and if you take oneplus 3t then why ? so let us answer these same questions further .
first of all , let &apos;s talk about the design of the phone , so let me tell you that this phone is exactly the same as the old version oneplus 3 .
available in slim metal design , you will see an antenna design in the back panel of this phone .
yes , there is a color difference this time in oneplus 3t .
this time , apart from soft gold , you will also get gun mantle gray .
the oneplus 3t has a 5.5-inch screen and the oneplus 3 was also introduced by the company with the same display .
the phone has a full hd optim amolet screen .
its screen resolution is 1080 × 1920 pixels and the screen is corning gorilla glass 4 coated .
overall , it can be said that there is no difference between the screen of the new model and the old model .
the oneplus 3 has been introduced on the qualco mm snapdragon 820 chipset and will see an octa-core octa-core processor of 2.15 ghz .
along with this , the adreno 530 gpu has been given in the phone .
it has been considered a great chipset .
the new model is based on the oneplus 3t qualco mm snapdragon 821 chipset .
this phone has a 2.35 ghz kryo processor .
it is considered to be the most powerful chipset ever for mobile .
at the same time , this phone also has adreno 530 gpu .
at the same time , it can be said that this phone is capable of supporting google &apos;s daydream vr project .
it is more advanced and stronger than the snapdragon 820 .
oneplus 3 was only with 64 gb memory option and it can not even get memory expansion .
the phone has 6 gb ram memory .
at the same time , oneplus 3t has been launched with 64 gb internal memory and 128 gb internal memory .
in both models , you will not get expandable memory support and both have 6 gb ram memory .
see a glimpse of moto g4 play
oneplus 3 has a 16-megapixel rear camera while the secondary camera is 8-megapixels .
it has a sony sensor and the phone has pdaf and ois support .
at the same time , oneplus 3t has a 16-megapixel selfie camera .
it has samsung 3p 89 sp sensor which gives the assurance of better picture .
at the same time , the rear camera is also 16-megapixel and the company has installed sony imx 298 sensor in it .
the phone has optical image stabilization support where you can take a clear picture even while moving .
the selfie camera in the new phone is better than before .
both phones run on oxygen operating system which is 6.0 marshmallow based on android operating system .
in such a situation , you will not get any significant difference in the use of both phones .
yes , you will get a bit more customization in oxygen os .
both phones are similar in terms of connectivity .
4g lte will be available with dual sim support .
along with this , wifi , bluetooth , gps and nfc have been given .
people often complain about battery backup regarding oneplus 3 .
in such a situation , the company has tried to address this complaint in the new phone .
oneplus 3t is better in terms of battery .
oneplus 3t has a battery of 3,400 mmh while the old phone has a 3,000 mah battery .
oneplus 3 is priced at rs 26,999 .
at the same time , the initial price of oneplus 3t can be rs 30,000 .
overall , in the new phone you get better chipset , upgraded selfie camera and powerful battery .
all other features are the same .
so it can be said that if you already have oneplus then it is not right to upgrade now .
at the same time , if you were thinking about taking oneplus 3 , then stop and wait for oneplus 3t .
after several days of discussion , lenovo finally launched the fab 2 plus smartphone in india .
this phone can be taken from the online store amazon india where its price is rs 14,999 .
this mid-range phone is equipped with great features .
but there are some devices that have the power to give it a tough competition .
the first of these is shaomi me max .
a few months ago , this phone has been introduced in india and it is no less in terms of specifications and features .
in such a situation , the question for consumers is which phone is better for them .
next we have tested both phones in every segment and based on that you can also conclude which device is better for you .
look and design
xiaomi mi max : xiaomi mi max is in all metal design , in which you will see an antenna band in the back panel .
the rear panel itself has a fingerprint sensor which is clickable like other phones of xiaomi .
in the device , you will get an edge-to-age screen .
the reason for this seems to be not too big despite the big screen .
however , it is a little difficult to use with one hand in ordinary palm .
now the quality can be said to be good .

recently motorola has launched moto g4 play smartphone in indian market .
the price of this phone is 8,999 rupees and it is available with online store amazon india .
it has been a few days since the phone was launched and you too must be wondering how this phone is .
what does it look like and is it worth the purchase or not .
in this post , we have tried to give you information about moto g4 play .
the phone &apos;s design , ui , software , hardware and camera are discussed .
this phone is not very beautiful to see , but it will make you feel better quality when taken in hand .
the phone has a wide screen of 5-inch 720 x 1280 pixels resolution .
in terms of display too , it can be said good in this budget , not very good .
better display phones are available in this budget .
xiaomi ready 3s prime is one of these .
the body of the phone is built on a metal frame and polycarbonate is used in the back panel .
the back panel of the phone seems to be a little rubber codet which protects the phone from slipping by hand .
it gives you a good grip .
there is usb slot in the bottom panel of the phone , 3.5 mm audio jack in the upper panel , and power and volume buttons are available in the right panel .
in the back panel , you can see the logo for moto .
although there is no branding of lenovo yet .
this 5-inch phone is capable of coming into your hands easily .
overall , it is good but the quality we expect from motorla does not live up to it .
dual sim
this phone has two sim specs and the sim slot is near the battery .
to install a sim or memory card , you must remove the battery .
both sim slots use microsim .
a 2,800 mah battery is provided for power backup .
the battery backup of the phone is good and is able to take out a day .
at the same time it can be said that in the back panel you can see that it has an nfc chip .
that is , you can avail data transfer and payment from nfc .
the phone has 4g support and you can use 4g sim in both slots .
it has volte support for 4g . you can use reliance jio sim .
the motorola moto g4 play has been introduced on the qualco mm snapdragon 410 chipset .
the phone has a 1.2 ghz cortex a-53 processor .
along with this , 2 gb ram memory and 16 gb internal memory has been given .
it has memory card support and you can use cards up to 256 gb .
overall , it is also average in terms of hardware .
can not say anything special .
phones like coolpad note 3 , xiaomi redmi 3s prime and leeco le 1s prove better than this .
moto g4 play has been launched on android operating system 6.0 marshmallow .
you will get to see stock android in it , which you can also call pure android .
there is no separate layer .
in the marshmallow interface , you can see the resend used app first .
at the same time it can be said that it will also get an update of the new operating system .
for photography , the moto g4 play has an 8-megapixel main camera and a 5-megapixel selfie camera .
there are options like auto focus , panorama , face detection and hdr with the camera , but there will not be much option .
it does not have a separate touch button to take a picture , rather you have to take a photo by touching the screen .
so photography may take a little while in the beginning .
the good thing is that the light settings will be found on the screen itself , this makes it very easy to adjust your lights .
we took pictures in good light conditions in indoor from the camera and that was fine .
it is not very special for low light .
we took this photo in good light condition in outdoor and took it very close .
no effect of any kind has been used while taking photos .
you can also experience how the photo itself .
there is no need to say much about this .
we took this photo from a short distance and got satisfactory results here too .
this picture is also taken from the moto g4 play itself and in it we have tried to take long shots and here too it is good in terms of 8-megapixels .
overall , with the camera , you can complain that 8-megapixel , why not 13-megapixel in this budget .
otherwise the picture quality is good .
ultimately , the question is why and why not take it .
so let me tell you that the reason for taking can be motorola brand , better software and good camera .
as far as not being taken , the average look , simple hardware and average display will come .
not having a fingerprint sensor can also be called a big drawback .
samsung galaxy m31 is a good phone in the budget segment , there is a lot of demand for it .
the name of the brand samsung and the powerful camera of 64 megapixels make it stand out from the others .
but there are some shortcomings in the phone that can make users a bit nervous .
if you are planning to take samsung galaxy m31 , then take a look at these shortcomings so that you can help in the choice of better phone .
1 design
the biggest strength of samsung galaxy m31 is its super amoled display .
the phone has a 6.4-inch screen and the design is also quite compact .
the phone is quite beautiful to see from the front .
but the feeling changes as you approach the bap panel .
there is a plastic body which is quite shiny .
but the biggest drawback is that fingerprints fall on it very quickly and after that this phone looks quite dirty .

2 face unlock
today , people also use fingerprint scanners and face unlock after pin password to lock the phone .
but if you use face unlock on samsung galaxy m31 , then you will spoil your time .
it is quite slow and even if the light changes its position , it does not open again .
yes ! fingerprint scanner works well .
3 sound quality
although the samsung galaxy m31 has dolby sound integration but the sound is quite slow and the base is also quite average .
the sound quality is not the same as we have seen in other samsung phones .
4 old processors
this phone works on samsung &apos;s own exynos 9611 processor .
this chipset is one year old and its effect will be seen on the performance of the phone .
the phone has some lag , but if you play the game for a long time then it will bother you more .
5 charging
the samsung galaxy m31 has gained a lot of headlines due to the superb display , 64 mp camera and 6,000 mah battery .

once charged , it removes one and a half to two days comfortably .
but it takes more than two hours to charge .

similarly , even after opening and closing an app , different animation will be seen .
real time animation based on app icon gestures will be included and can be used by swiping right and left .
5 . privacy enhancements
miui 12 has been made more secure by xiaomi than the earlier ui .
it has been heard that for miui 12 , the company has used mobile ai compute engine ie mace framework .
this will make xiaomi phones more secure than before .
details like users &apos; privacy like phone gallery , photo , mail account , location , message , contact and call history will be safe in the ui .
it is discussed that the new feature will also include &apos; app behavior &apos; , through which the user interface itself will monitor the apps to see which app is doing something that is not good for security .
apart from the above features , options like audio and sound effect , battery features , notifications and performance have also been updated in miui 12 which will be clear only when this user interface comes on the market .
there is no doubt that &apos; wheel &apos; is the biggest discovery in history .
one wheel rotated the whole world .
but even electricity cannot be considered a less important discovery .
not only illuminated the houses , but also gave such strength to the industry that without electricity nothing is possible today .
but the funniest thing seems to be that anything smaller than a button produces power with a weight of two grams per gram and provides the power to move a watch or a toy for months .
don &apos;t you feel magic even after looking at mobile ? what the mobile could not do with the help of a small battery .
let us know the story of making this battery today .
how portable lithium batteries were born after big batteries .
what is battery
there are many sources of power generation , one of them is battery .
however , the electricity that comes through a wire connection to a power house or home is different from the battery power .
electricity comes into the house , it is called &apos; ac &apos; or &apos; alternative current &apos; .
whereas &apos; dc &apos; means the direct current through the battery .
ac is known to have a high voltage and it operates in a circular current .
that is , rise up , fall down and then rise up .
this cycle goes on continuously .
so when you look at a bulb from a distance , it will feel like it is flickering .
whereas separate dcs are generally used for devices with low voltage capacitance .
in this , electricity goes on in a uniform flow .
therefore , the flow of electricity from the battery is always shown on a straight line .
type of battery
battery has many technologies and formats .
almost different types of batteries are used today for every device .
small battery for small device which is used for many things including torch , camera and radio .
at the same time there is a large battery for large devices .
such as carts , inverters etc .
but the most surprising of these is by looking at the battery in the handwatch and the small toy .
these batteries , smaller than the button , are able to provide long-term power backup .
however , where larger batteries are rechargeable .
at the same time , these button-sized batteries end only after use .
the same laptop uses a different type of battery and a different type of battery for mobiles .
it is important to mention one thing here that even if a battery is rechargeable and one is for single use , but everyone has life and it deteriorates after a time .
dry cell and wet cell
except for the shape of the texture , there are usually two types of batteries .
one dry cell and another wet cell .
both use chemicals and both cells produce electricity from acids , but the method changes .
dry cell use is of no use after it is over .
while the water cell can be rebuilt and used .
also read : listen to us once so that you can listen later too !
if we talk about mobile then a different technology is used here .
it is a dry cell but is made of lithium-ion and lithium-polymer .
when did battery invent
the first credit for the manufacture of the battery goes to the italian physicist alessandro volta .
in 1792 , he tested the electrochemical cell for the first time and in 1800 ad he also manufactured the first battery .
at that time he was known as &apos; voltaic pile &apos; .
although it had shown that the use of chemical can make the battery , but it was not a very successful experiment .
in 1836 , john frederic daniell was used to rejuvenate this experiment .
he used zinc sulfate and copper sulphate for seedling production .
this low voltage battery was capable of producing electricity for a long time and the name of this cell was named &apos; daniel cell &apos; .
this cell was used extensively for telephony services in the us at that time .
after this experiment , small improvements were made in the battery manufacturing process which proved to be very important .
ac was a small effort , gaston planté he built a rechargeable battery for the first time in 1859 .
an important experiment also emerged in 1860 .
monsieur callaud , a french scientist , introduced a new design of the daniel cell .
it was named &apos; gravity cell &apos; and became more compact than before .
in 1866 , the second scientist from france , georges leclanché , created the first anode and cathode based dry cell .
at the same time , in 1881 , carl gassner manufactured several other types of batteries on the same technology and also got german patents on it .
simultaneously he started mass production of batteries .
now the battery became available to the common people .
similarly , in 1899 , the swedish scientist waldermar jungner produced a nickel cadium battery .
who does not know the name of thomas edison .
he has also contributed in this field .
in 1903 , he patented a new use of alkine cells with nickel-iron cells , which became quite popular .
in this , alkine served as anode and nickel oxide cathode .
potassium chloride was also used in this .
this battery was mainly used for automobiles .
zinc carbon batteries were greatly improved in 1955 and today &apos;s batteries are available with the same improvements .
the credit for this improvement goes to engineer lewis urry .
when did lithium ion battery come
the history of lithium batteries is not very old .
it is also called modern battery .
it was first used by a uk scientist , stanley whittingham .
when the whole world was struggling with the oil problem in 1970 .
at that time , he was working in exxon mobile and at that time he had shown a new experiment with rechargeable batteries .
for this he used titanium and lithium metal .
however it was not very successful .
but in 1980 , us scientist john b. goodenough carried this experiment forward and used lithium cobalt oxide in place of titanium , which was able to supply twice as much power as the old experiment .
5 years later , another experiment was carried out and this was done by japanese scientist akira yoshino .
he first introduced a prototype of modern lithium batteries .
this is where a new chapter in the history of lithium ion batteries was added .
the first commercial lithium ion battery on this experiment was produced in 1991 by sony and asahi cassai and led by yoshio nishi , the development team .
it is a matter of lithium polymer battery , it is part of lithium ion .
according to our knowledge , it was first used in 1997 and this battery was also manufactured by sony and asahi cassai company together .
you also need to know that in 2019 , the nobel prize in chemistry was given to stanley wettingham , john b. goodinf and ekira yoshino for manufacturing lithium ion batteries .
what is lithium ion battery
lithium ion battery is a link in the rechargeable battery series .
it is a portable battery capable of fast charging and high capacity power .
apart from the small size and high power , long-term charging is also its specialty .
it is very similar to a double a battery which consists of three parts .
one is cobalt oxide positive electrode which we also call cathode and the other is graphite carbon negative electrode called anode .
the cathode is positive power while the anode is negative power .
as i already said it consists of three parts .
so the third part works to keep these two apart .
technically both these cathode and anode are inside the electrolyte chemical .
that is , they are kept in a box or bag of the same chemical , but not with them , but they are different .
strips , insulin tape or rubber tape are used to separate them .
when the battery is charged , ions flow from the cathode to the anode and activate the electrochemical and store the power .
similarly , when the battery is in use , the ions flow from the anode to the cathode .
in this way the phone has a power spleen and a battery discharge .
this is how lithium ion batteries work .
in colloquial language , it is also called li-ion battery .
it is the same technique of lithium polymer battery .
it uses solid polyethylene oxide or polycranylionitrile with lithium .
similar to a leone battery , it can be made in a small package and is easy to use .
generally speaking , it is known as li-po battery .
mah
the battery is lithium ion or lithium polymer .
but both technologies definitely use mah .
do you know what this mah is ?
in fact , mah is a measure of its strength .
battery power is measured through ampere hour and the ampere hour found for charging in small devices is measured .
mah means ampere hour .
1 milli ampere hour is one thousandth of an ampere hour .
that is , 1 ampere hour = 1000 ml ampere .
in this way , the more mah a battery has , the more battery backup it will be able to provide .
lithium batteries are also used in cars
on hearing the name of lithium battery , you will think about the small battery which is used in small devices including mobile and camera .
but let me tell you that now lithium batteries are also being used in electrical cars .
renowned brands like tesla have started using it .
there was a discussion about apple since last year that the company is working on the new version of its cheap and iconic phone iphone se and which will be offered on the tech platform at a low price .
realizing the eagerness of iphone lovers , apple launched an upgraded version of the iphone se in india last week .
this phone has been launched in the market as apple iphone se 2020 .
while some people liked the iphone se , the expectations set by this device by many iphone lovers are also broken .
since the phone &apos;s launch , we have tested people &apos;s reactions to the iphone se 2020 and find out what are the things that have disappointed them with the new iphone .
lack of design
apple iphone se 2020 is built on durable glass and aluminum design , which is very glossy and shiny in appearance .
but apple has not made any changes in the display style of this iphone .
the company has introduced this phone on the old bezels design keeping it away from the trend of notch .
some users may like this old style , but there are many iphone users who have been disappointed by this design in the era of full view and punch-hole display .
let us tell you that the new iphone se has a width of 2.65 inches , height 5.45 inches and depth 0.29 inches and the phone weighs 148 grams .
big display demand
apple has launched the iphone se 2020 on the 4.7-inch retina hd display .
today , from low budget to flagship segment , most mobile phones are launching with screens up to 6 inches .
in such a situation , the display of the new iphone is considered small by many users and disliked it .
significantly , this display is 1334 x 750 pixels resolution , which supports 326 ppi .
in the new iphone se , the company has used lcd multi-touch display which is equipped with ips technology .
the display has a contrast ratio of 1400 : 1 , which offers a maximum brightness of 625 nits .
single camera left alone
apple iphone se 2020 supports single rear camera .
today , hardly any phone has setup of less than triple rear camera .
in such a situation , except for the dual setup in the new iphone , only one camera has been given to apple fans .
the back panel of this phone has a 12-megapixel wide camera sensor with f / 1.8 aperture with led true tone flash light .
low battery backup
first of all , let me tell you that ios in iphones uses very less battery compared to android smartphones .
in this case , the low mah battery present in the iphones also has the ability to compete with the larger mah given in the android .
the iphone se 2020 has been launched on an 1821 mah battery that supports 18 w charging .
but in the era of pubg , when most people spend time playing games on the phone and it also consumes more battery , apple was expected to give a slightly larger battery .
let me tell you here that the new iphone also supports wireless charging .
no cheap feeling
apple has launched the iphone se 2020 with 3 gb of ram in three storage variants which include 64 gb storage , 128 gb storage and 256 gb storage .
the base variant with 64 gb storage of the phone has been launched for rs 42,500 .
similarly , the 128 gb storage variant of the phone has been launched in the market at a price of rs 47,800 and 256 gb storage variant at rs 58,300 .
while the iphone se is known as apple &apos;s cheap phone , apple fans have not been satisfied with the price of the phone .
users were hoping to be a little more cheap .
india is going through lockdown 2.0 these days .
due to coronavirus , the whole of india has been closed since may 3 and people have been instructed to stay indoors .
the lockdown period is going to be about 1 month .
october is a time for people locked in their homes to stay away from their friends , family and relatives .
in such a situation , the only means for people to see and meet each other is &apos; video call &apos; .
the use of video calling during lockdown has already increased manifold .
from single calling to group video calls and video conferencing is being done continuously .
recently , some comments were made by the government on the zoom app , after which there was a confusion among people about the difference between zoom app and whatsapp and how the two are different from each other .
today we have told the difference and similarities of these two apps .
whatsapp vs zoom app
1 . first of all , let us tell you that while whatsapp is an instant messaging app , zoom app has got the status of video conferencing app .
2 . whatsapp was started in 2009 , while zoom app started working in 2011 .
3 . whatsapp is being used today by more than 1 billion people in 180 countries , while zoom app is still far away from the common people and its main reason is that this app has to be made for professional use .
4 . the main use of whatsapp is to send and receive text messages to people .
the major use of the zoom app is to make video calls .
5 . it is not that there cannot be a video call on whatsapp .
you can also make video calls on this app , but even after the new update , only up to 8 people can video chat at a time .
at the same time , up to 100 people can be added to a video call at a time on the zoom app .
6 . whatsapp is completely free to use .
at the same time , the zoom app is a freemium app .
freemium means free + premium .
here you can use many features of the app for free , but to use some features , you will have to buy premium access to this app by paying money .
7 . the biggest difference between these two is that whatsapp is an end-to-end encrypted app but not so with zoom app .
end-to-end encryption is where the sender and receiver of the message are linked by a link and no third person can see the message except for the two .
messages shared on whatsapp are limited to two people , but this is not the case with the zoom app .
any third party can also see and use your message in it .
unsafe told zoom app
explain that the ministry of home affairs of the government of india has said that the zoom app is not a secure app and it can be easily hacked .
the government has instructed that it is prudent to stop using this app and it should be deleted from your phone and laptop .
at the same time , the government has also issued a new advisory for those who cannot stop using this app under compulsion .
it has been said that the video calling on this app can be hacked and the user &apos;s personal data can be stolen .
according to the report , more than 35 percent of people using the zoom app are estimated to be data theft .
zoom app &apos;s server is directly connected to china and the serious thing is that this app has also been used by many big leaders of the country .
the mobile market is huge and new innovations are seen here everyday .
considering the size of the market , new brands come here every day , but there are few that can last long .
lack of experience or incorrect strategy , consumers are not able to sense the pulse .
one thing of the mobile industry , you will also believe that every six months the entire market changes .
in such a situation , the risk of disappearance is not only on the new brands , but many times the old and experienced players have to give up .
you will remember that once upon a time , the condition and direction of the mobile market used to decide the brands like nokia , motorola and soni , but now these brands have been lost somewhere .
somehow you are living , but in what condition do you also know .
at the same time , a brand like blackberry was completely destroyed .
however , whatever the circumstances , there is a brand which not only understood the pulse of the consumer but also changed itself according to the times and still stands as the number one mobile manufacturer in the world .
yes ! you understand right i am talking about samsung .
this is the only company in the mobile world that has spent more than 40 years and still remains the first choice of users , so today i am going to tell you one such untold story of the brand samsung .
how the company has traveled from arsh to floor .

brand samsung
there is no doubt that the samsung mobile segment is very big and the company is known for many innovations , but let &apos;s take a look at samsung becoming a broad samsung .
samsung is a south korean company with a head office in seoul .
according to the korean name , samsung means &quot; three star &quot; , that is , three star and this company is shining today as per its name .
it was founded in 1938 by lee byung chul , and was then registered as a trading company .
but in the next three decades , samsung emerged very fast and stepped into many areas .
these include food processing , textiles , insurance , security and retail .
by the 1970s , the company had also ventured into shipbuilding and construction .
samsung electronics was launched in 1969 but at that time the company was much smaller in this area .
however , samsung entered the tv and semiconductor manufacturing sector with japanese company sanyo and nec in the 70s and by 1981 the company had manufactured over 10 million black and white tvs .
also read : in this year , these explosive mobile games broke records , have you also played these games ?
this was in a way the beginning of the company &apos;s electronic manufacturing .
after 1980 , samsung ventured into manufacturing dram and rom , digital chip memory and today the company has become the number one chip maker in the world .
on the other hand , in the display segment , samsung also flashed its glory .
the lcd display panel was first introduced by the company in 1995 , which was extensively used for other displays including tvs , computer screens and mobiles .

samsung mobile phone
as we mentioned that in the 80s , the company had entered into the field of semiconductor and digital memory chip manufacturing and this is where mobile started .
the company launched the first mobile phone in 1988 with the model sh-100 , which was launched in korea .
the sgh-200 was introduced by samsung in the same year and was the first phone from the company that was also launched outside europe in korea .
however , this phone could not do anything special at that time .
you will also be surprised to know that at that time , 60 percent of the market was occupied by motorala and only 10 percent was samsung .
but the company did not give up in innovation and continued to bring something new .
the sh-770 model was introduced by samsung in 1994 .
this was the company &apos;s first three-line display phone with an icon at the top , number below it and menu option at the bottom .
from here , the company started to feel like .
in 1996 , samsung introduced the sch-100 , the company &apos;s first cdma phone .
similarly , in 1998 the sch-800 arrived and was successful in sending samsung &apos;s phone messages from here .
this was the same period when the number of mobile users around the world was increasing rapidly , mobile services were started in india too , call rates started falling and innovations in mobile phones started .
the year 1999 was very important for samsung mobile where the company introduced several innovations one after the other .
in 1999 , the company introduced the first phone which could store mp3 songs and also had the option of play back .
but even bigger innovation was samsung &apos;s &apos; watch phone &apos; .
yes , today smartwatches are being talked about , but in 1999 the company introduced sph-wp10 , you could tie this phone on the wrist .
although it was a bit big but was fun .
similarly , in 1999 , samsung sph-m220 phone came , which was the company &apos;s first tv phone .
you could play analog tv in it .
an antenna was given in the phone .
this in itself could be said to be a very big thing .
the following year in 2000 , the company introduced the sch-a2000 model .
it was a flap design phone with a display on the inside and outside cover that was able to convey calls and messages over time .
in a way , the dual display started from here .
the same year the company introduced the sph-v200 phone and it was the first samsung phone to have a digital camera .
however , it was not the world &apos;s first camera phone .
then came that crucial year of 2002 when the company launched its first color display phone .
after this , samsung &apos;s color began to filter on the legs .
the company launched the sch-x430 model which featured a color display with a flap design .
the same year the company set another record samsung &apos;s sgh-t100 model became the first phone to have 10 million cells .
in 2002 , the company introduced another new innovation , the sch-v300 model which had video on demand service support .
samsung was moving forward step by step and in 2004 another new chapter was added to the company &apos;s mobile history .
samsung introduced the sch-a790 model this year , which was a dual sim phone and was given cdma support with gsm .
the same year the sgh-v500 mobile phone was introduced .
due to its rotating display , this phone was highly appreciated .
in this only year this year is not over .
the sph-s2300 handset was introduced by samsung in the year 2004 .
it was the first phone to use 3.2x optical zoom .
the company has already introduced the zoom that is being talked about 16 years ago .
in 2005 , another phone from the company was in the news and its model number was sch-b250 .
it was the first phone of the company to have a 2.2-inch 262k color screen .
this phone was equipped with dvm technology and was capable of streaming live tv .
at the same time this year , the company introduced a very innovative phone samsung sgh-e910 which is known as sirin , in which a dialer was given like the phone .
now era was moving towards the touch screen .
in 2007 , the company introduced t919 behold , the first touch screen phone .
after that models like samsung f700 were launched .
the company &apos;s mattel series became quite popular in touch screens .
in addition , the samsung corby and omnia series received worldwide acclaim .
but galaxy phone did the work of writing history .
the company most recently introduced the samsung gt-i7500 galaxy in 2009 .
it was the first phone to be launched on android operating .
however , 2009 was the time to write history for samsung .
the same year the company introduced the sch-w850 with an amoled display .
earlier , nokia had brought amoled display with n85 .
but from here on samsung like amoled display has taken its right .
the year 2010 proved to be an important year for samsung again .
it was here that the galasy s series started and it was the first phone to use a super amoled panel .
at the same time , 2011 was the turning point when samsung &apos;s biggest innovation came and it was samsung galaxy note , both these series are being launched continuously till now .
in 2012 , the galaxy s3 introduced hd super amoled and in 2013 the galaxy s4 with full hd super amoled panel was introduced .
the year 2012 was very special for the company .
this is the year that samsung became the number one smartphone manufacturer in the world , ending nokia &apos;s reign .
in 2014 , the company introduced the heart rate sensor in the phone along with the galaxy s5 .
in 2015 , the company launched the galaxy s6 and the phone was water and dust proof .
the company has introduced innovation step-by-step very prominently .
at the same time , the note became more smart and aspen was not only equipped with the remort control feature but was also capable of multi-tasking .
in 2017 , the company launched infinity display with galaxy s8 and from there the display market changed .
in 2018 , samsung introduced the galaxy s9 model .
do you remember what made that phone popular ? no , let me tell you .
dual aperture was introduced with the camera for the first time in this phone .
the same sensor supports two apertures .
the year of 2019 has also been very special for samsung .
the company introduced the world &apos;s first 5g phone , the galaxy s10 .
with this , the foldable display also started from here .
the company launched the galaxy fold , which was considered to be one of the most innovative phones of the year .
in 2020 , even though the whole world was in a war over corona , the company had already shown its innovation .
the galaxy s20 series was introduced by samsung this year with a 108-megapixel camera with 100x zoom support .
apart from this , innovative phones like galaxy z flip are also being well liked by the people .
the kind of innovation that samsung has done so far in the mobile world and has come a long way , it is expected that the company will continue to move forward with the same enthusiasm .

when reliance jio entered the indian market , a new revolution was seen in the telecom sector .
jio made telecom services very affordable and all companies offered tariff plans at a cheaper price .
but now again , the indian telecom department is going to see a big change .
but let me tell you that this time this change is going to prove bad , not good .
a supreme court verdict has created a stir in the telecom sector , and its direct impact on the general public is certain .
vodafone idea and airtel have said that from december 1 , they are going to make their plans expensive .
not only this , telecom users may have to pay a hefty amount on many services .
in such a situation , it becomes important to know why these companies are taking such strict decisions after making plans cheap .
first of all , let us tell you that at this time the indian telecom industry is facing the biggest loss in history .
this loss has fallen on 15 telecom companies of the country and now common users will also have to bear the loss of telecom companies .
vodafone idea and airtel have incurred huge losses with this change .
it is being told that while vodafone idea has suffered a loss of 50,921 crore , airtel has also suffered a loss of 23,044 crore .
agr is the name to shake the telecom companies
what happens agr
adjusted gross revenue ( agr ) means adjusted gross revenue .
adjusted gross revenue is a tax levied by the department of telecommunications , which is collected from telecom companies in exchange for usage and license related services .
all this controversy and the agonizing issue of telecom companies is with agr itself .
the controversy that has been going on since 2003 has been called off this year .
on october 24 , the supreme court changed the definition of agr .
the court has ruled in favor of dot , ending the dispute .
the court has ordered that all telecom companies will have to pay their full dues within 3 months .
what is dispute
the dispute about which services should be within the scope of adjusted gross revenue is 15 years old , which has been running since the year 2003 .
the demand of the telecom companies was that only the revenue received on the licensed services should be kept under the agr and the companies would only give the share received from it to the government .
but the department of telecommunications said that all services related to telecom companies should be covered under agr and tax should be levied on them .
now this situation was
under the agr , only income related to phone services was included earlier .
that is , the companies used to pay the tax to the government according to the earnings of the telecom companies from services like selling sim , calling , internet , message , ringtone , alert and roaming .
under the old definition , only 5 percent spectrum usage fee and 8 percent licensing fee were paid in adjusted gross revenue .
this new change
after pleading with the department of telecom , the supreme court has decided that under the adjusted gross revenue ( agr ) , along with phone services , interest will also be charged to the companies .
not only this , under the new definition , the telecom companies will now pay tax to the government on the money received from selling their property and the money received from renting a property .
they will all be covered under the agr from now on .
1,34,000 crores outstanding
the telecom department submitted its report to the supreme court in july , which included the names of 15 telecom companies .
the list also included names of existing telecom companies of india as well as the telecom companies that have worked in the indian market during the past years .
in this report , the dot gave a complete account of how much revenue is owed to which company .
at the same time , these telecom companies will have to pay this amount after the supreme court in october .
the 15 telecom companies on the list will have to pay a total dues of rs 1,34,000 crore .
of this amount , 93,000 crore rupees are only license tax , fine and interstate amount , whereas 41 thousand crore rupees will have to be paid in exchange for spectrum usage .
according to this report , vodafone idea and airtel have to pay rs 80,000 crore to the government .
on the other hand , anil ambani &apos;s r com will have to pay rs 20,000 crore and tata teleservices will have to pay rs 13,000 crore as revenue .
fear in telecom companies
vodafone company ceo nick read had said after the supreme court order that the company would no longer invest in india .
but after being criticized later , nick clarified and apologized to prime minister modi , saying that his statement was misrepresented .
at the same time , the birla group of idea , a partner company of vodafone , has said that they do not have the money to pay the fees , now they cannot invest more .

photography in mobile phones started with vga camera .
you will also remember the quality of the vga camera .
despite having low quality and low-quality pixels , photographs were made and videos were made with great passion .
in the last few years , smartphone technology has become quite advanced , as well as mobile phone camera .
today 5 camera sensors are being given in a single phone .
a few months ago when the world &apos;s first 64 mp camera smartphone arrived , there was a stir in the entire tech world .
these smartphones were compared to photography cameras .
at the same time , taking this technology four steps ahead , smartphones with 108 mp cameras have also knocked .
xiaomi has launched the world &apos;s first smartphone equipped with 108 megapixel camera technology and samsung has created this camera technology .
samsung itself introduced the 64 megapixel camera technology that used the isocell gw1 sensor .
at the same time , samsung has developed isocell bright hmx sensor technology to bring 108 megapixel camera phone .
smartphones equipped with this technology are being compared to dslrs .
but in any smartphone , only high megapixels are not enough .
many aspects of photography are employed for a good picture that can work in all kinds of environments .
in samsung isocell bright hmx , the company has worked on all the points that give excellent results by capturing a better photo .
next we have written about this sensor , in which you can know how the 108 megapixel camera works and what are the special features in it .
this is how it works
the isocell bright hmx is built on the isocell plus pixel , the first mobile sensor in the tech world to support 108 megapixels .
samsung has used smart iso and tetracell technology in isocell bright hmx sensor , which gives better results even in very low light .
this sensor combines four pixels to form one large pixel , which increases the illumination even in low light conditions .
smart wdr i.e. wide dynamic range in the sensor gives wide exposure to the lens when the photo is clicked , due to which maximum object detail and light is captured in the frame .
in this frame , more detail of both the bright and dark sides of the object is captured .
this new sensor is 1 / 1.33-inch with the ability to absorb maximum light .
also , due to the lack of noise in the photo , the colors of the object are also captured well .
let us now look at the great features of this powerful sensor :
highest resolution
the isocell bright hmx is designed to capture advanced and high-quality photos and videos .
you will be surprised to know that with this sensor of 108 megapixels , a photo with 12032 x 9024 pixels resolution can be clicked .
not only this , if the video is recorded from a phone equipped with this sensor , then it can make a film with 6k resolution i.e. 6016 x 3384 pixels .
this sensor is capable of capturing 30fps i.e. 30 frames in 1 second .
photo will also be taken of the running object
here object means you can consider a person or an animal .
when an object is moving at extremely high speed , then every pixel does not get sharpened on its photo capture and some blur remains .
but the 3 stack frs used in isocell bright hmx i.e. fast readout sensor and dual pd ( phase detection auto focus + dual pixels and super phase detection sensor ) also captures fast moving object very well .
this sensor captures the object &apos;s distance , its speed , so that all pixels of the object , foreground , and background are sharpened in the camera .
smart iso
for a perfect photo , the light should neither be high nor low .
the specialty of isocell bright hmx is that it balances sensor light .
smart iso has been used in this sensor technology .
the smart iso intelligently judges the light in the environment and cuts off the extra light and converts only as much light as needed into an electric signal and sends it to the lens .
along with this process , it automatically switches to low iso and improves pixel saturation and produces vivid images .
similarly , in low light environment , this sensor switches to high iso and captures clear photos by reducing the noise of the object .
amazing light sensing
this camera sensor , equipped with 108 megapixel power , captures the rich , clear details of every object in the frame along with sharp photographs .
the isocell bright hmx sensor supports isocell plus technology as well as 0.8 micrometer pixels , which makes the sensor capture clearer and clearer photos by increasing light and color sensitivity .
the lls in the sensor , ie low light shooting and depth sensing technology , also makes the depth effect by focusing the object even in low light .
tetracell technology captures 27 megapixel bright photos in low light .
often mobile users will be seen saying that &apos; today is the craze of pubg &apos; , but just think is it really praji &apos;s craze or is there something else ? according to me , the answer would be that pubg is in the news but the craze is about mobile games .
people will be seen playing games even in office , home , bus , train , metro and airplane .
the reason for this is that now a powerful mobile phone has come in the hands of people .
once 512 mb ram was considered big , but today phones with 4,6 and 8 gb ram are in the budget which has 64 gb and 128 gb memory with 6 inch big screen .
along with this , there is a gpu with powerful octa-core processors ie graphics processor unit which renders heavy graphics easily in mobile .

vivo z1 pro has been launched in the mead budget , which is equipped with great features as well as strong specifications .
the first competition of vivo z1 pro in this segment is from xiaomi &apos;s note 7 pro .
on the one hand , while xiaomi has a strong fan following in the country , on the other hand , the fans of vivo phones are also less .
while the starting price of vivo z1 pro is rs 14,990 , the starting price of redmi note 7 pro is rs 13,999 .
in such a situation , the question is arising whether to take a vivo phone or go to xiaomi .
after using both the smartphones together , we have told what the latest vivo z1 pro has lost and found compared to redmi note 7 pro .

the z1 pro is bigger than the note 7 pro in terms of size .
lost
the wide display of vivo z1 pro makes one-hand use a bit difficult .
the palm has to be stretched more for the rear fingerprint .
found
the punch-hole display is what makes vivo z1 pro special .
the color gradient of the phone is worth flaunting between friends .
fullview display enhances phone attraction .
the vivo z1 pro has been launched by the company on a 6.53-inch fullhd + display with 2340 × 1080 pixel resolution .

while xiaomi has kept the phone screen coated with gorilla glass 5 , protection has not been given in vivo z1 pro .
lack of screen protection in vivo z1 pro is a major drawback .
the big display makes the video and gaming experience in the phone great .
… … ..

what is upgrade
after the arrival of a new phone , you often discuss what is the upgrade .
that is , how much has changed from the old phone
so let me tell you that if we compare xiaomi redmi 6a and redmi 7a , there will not be much difference .
the main difference is battery and processor .
apart from this there are weight cameras and some minor disparities .
the rest of the screen and camera sensors are the same .
first , there will be a slight difference in weight .
the new phone has become about 20 grams heavier .
the redmi 6a weighs 145 grams while the redmi 7a weighs 165 grams .
however , the reason is battery .
the older model was with a 3,000 mah battery while the redmi 7a has been introduced in china with a 4,000 mah battery and is expected to be the same in india .
at the same time , redmi 6a was introduced by the company on the mediatek helia a22 chipset , while this time there will be a qualco mm snapdragon 439 processor .
ram and rom may be the same .
the camera sensor is also similar to 6a but this time the company can use micron pixels so that the photo is better than before .
yes ! recently there has been a news that according to which usb type-c can be given in the model launched in india , while in china , micro usb 2.0 has come along .
will the deal be beneficial
ultimately , the question comes as to what the price of redmi 7a will be and whether it will be beneficial to take it .
in the indian market , the initial price of xiaomi redmi 7a can be rs 5,999 .
at this price , it can be called a good phone , but realme c2 is already available to challenge it .
the mediatek helio p22 chipset based phone has a dual rear camera .
along with this , there is a water drop notch .
in this case , the path is not easy this time for xiaomi redmi 7a .
at the beginning of every month , we decide our budget and along with this , we also guess what will happen in the whole month .
july has started and this month is going to bring a lot .
you must have guessed your house , but in the mobile world , what is going to happen this month , we are going to tell you .

if you want to open any website on the internet or search for any url , then www is written first .
any web address starts with these three w &apos;s .
like if you want to open facebook , www.facebook.com and if you want to open our 91 mobile website www.91mobiles.com / en / tech
every website on the internet starts with www , which means the world wide web .
today i.e. on march 12 , the world wide web has completed 30 years .
and by creating a doodle on this occasion , google has also celebrated the 30th anniversary of the world wide web in a special way .
on this birthday of the world wide web , which plays a very important role in the world of internet , let us tell you 5 such interesting things , due to which your work on the internet today is done in a pinch .
how the world wide web started
the world wide web was started by sir tim berners lee .
the world wide web was created in 1989 while working at the european institution cern .
lee proposed a hypertext system to link different computers in one place and to access all computers simultaneously , which later became known as www .
it took 2 years for the world wide web to be fully developed .
but at the time , tim lee did not even know that the world wide web ( www ) would go on to take such a large size and change the use of the internet .
this was the first website
the world wide web has given a distinct identity to any website on the internet .
accessing the website without the world wide web on a web browser was not possible .
the world wide web was brought to the world for the first time in 1991 after work started in 1889 .
the internet started on 6 august this year , and with the help of the world wide web , the first website of the world was revealed , which was info.cern.ch ! it is important to note that without the world wide web , the url address of any website remains incomplete . 89 percent buyers want pamper camera in smartphone , see report
the world wide web is an application made up of html , url and http .
each web browser understands html language .
earlier where browsers used to support only html , now it has also started supporting other languages ​ ​ like xhtml .
any page is positioned as a url ( uniform resource locator ) , in common language it is also known as the address of the website .
this web address starts with http .
in addition to http , many browsers also support other url types and their protocols such as gopher , ftp .
growth over time
the world wide web has been made public in april 1993 .
the manufacturers kept this software completely free to the public and demanded instead to give suggestions for improvements and shortcomings .
since then no payment has been made for the use of www .
it was only in 1993 that a search engine called mosaic was launched , which was the first engine in the world to show pictures .
this gave new light to the world of internet .
over time internet explorer came in 1990 and today browsers and search engines like google chrome and mozilla are available . nokia 6.2 smartphone coming soon , price will be around nokia 6.1
internet status in india
internet service in india began 6 years after the birth of the internet .
the introduction of internet in india is considered to be 15 august 1995 .
meanwhile , the use of the internet was made public for the public today .
this service was started by videsh sanchar limited .
today , india comes in the top category among internet-using nations .
not only computers or laptops but mobile devices also have a lot of internet access in india .

3 . punch hole screen
punch hole display phones will also become trend in the year 2019 by going one step ahead of the notch .
samsung started it with the galaxy s8s but this phone has not yet arrived in india .
in india , honor view 20 is the first phone to be introduced with a punch hole display .
although it is a bit expensive , but the punch hole phones will come in the budget of rs 15,000 by the end of the year .
the notch is in the middle of the screen .
at the same time under the punch hole , a hole is made at some place of the screen and a selfie camera is available on it .
the camera has always been a very trending feature and will also play an important role in 2019 .
the most important thing can be said that while there was a lot of discussion about dual camera phones last year , this time there will be talk of triple camera phones .
samsung started it in the low range with the galaxy a7 .
at the same time , there is a lot of talk about vivo &apos;s new phones v15 and v15 pro as well .

rajinikanth &apos;s robot 2.0 movie has already been watched by all of you .
in this movie , it is mainly shown how mobile networks and mobile towers harm birds and the environment .
the issue of how radiation and rays emanating from the mobile can harm the issue is explained in robot 2.0 .
you must have understood that radiation of mobile networks is very dangerous for birds and environment as well as our health .
but do you know that the smartphone on which you are currently reading this article is hurting you so much ? next we have given this essential information in our article .
what is the essence
first of all , let us tell you that every smartphone has its own different radiation and frequency .
a mobile phone is a radio transmitter that sends and receives network waves ( waves ) .
these waves are called radio frequency electromagnetic fields .
these waves are transferred through the mobile antenna which travels from the phone to the mobile tower and from the mobile tower to the phone .
whenever these waves are transferred , some percentage of them keeps moving in the atmosphere .
and this is the part that poses a threat to you , us and the environment .
how dangerous
the waves emanating from the mobile are not always uniform .
when the phone is doing many things at once , it increases and during low use of the phone these waves are reduced .
these waves emanating from the smartphone are measured through &apos; abstract value &apos; .
sar ( specific absorption rate ) . summary value is the rate that measures the waves emitted from the phone and the waves absorbed by the human body .
these waves are absorbed by the tissue present in the blood in the body .
abstract value standards in india
every smartphone has different essence value .
this summary value is decided by the government of every country and phones with more abstract value than the fixed value are banned in that country .
let us tell you that the essence value fixed by the governments of india and america is the same .
in india , the maximum value of mobile phones is 1.6 w / kg .
here watt / kg means that a 1 kg tissue can absorb a maximum power of 1.6 watt waves .
who is so safe
when we tested the summary value of the recently launched smartphones , the samsung galaxy m10 &apos;s essence value was found to be 0.238 w / kg , while the galaxy m20 &apos;s essence value was found to be 0.273 w / kg .
let me tell you that from the point of view of any smartphone , this summary value is extremely low .
similarly , india &apos;s first 48 mp camera honor view 20 was found to have 1.09 w / kg , poco f1 at 0.719 w / kg and realme u1 at 1.187 w / kg .
you can see that samsung has the lowest abstract value .
this means that samsung phones are the safest for your health .
perhaps this is the reason why the company often talks of best quality and claims its phone to be of international standard .
at the same time , the reason behind the samsung phone being expensive , is that our phones are all scale .
how to view abstract in your phone
if you also want to know the summary value of your phone , then dial * # 07 # from your smartphone .
after dialing this number , the summary value of the phone will come on the display of the phone .
the engaged hands should also inform you that the abstract value is divided into two parts .
the first head sar means head and body sar .
whenever we talk on the phone , the head is closest to the mobile .
therefore the abstract value of the head is kept separate .
similarly , when the phone is in the pocket or in the hand , the abstract value for that situation is measured separately .
since last year , there was talk that samsung will introduce its smartphones inside its m series .

there is no doubt that reliance jio has changed the condition and direction of the indian mobile market .
the company was very aggressive with launching its services in india .
for the first six months , free people gave data and calling .
later , when the duty was implemented , it was extremely low .
not only this , calling on the live network is free forever , only the data has to be recharged .
due to these services offered by reliance jio , people took jio sim hands-on and within a year of its launch , the company crossed 100 million users .
it is now going to be three years and a user base of 300 million .
even now jio is offering data and calling services at the lowest price .
but it is not that all the offers of jio are good but there are many prepaid tariff plans which are expensive .
although they have been offered for long validity , but are they beneficial for users ? let &apos;s look further and mention this in detail .
live plan of 999 rupees
reliance jio has launched a long validity prepaid plan .
in which the first plan is 999 rupees .
under this plan , you get 60 gb of data with a validity of 90 days .
along with this , unlimited calling is also available .
apart from this , national roaming is free as well as the company also gives 100 messages every day .
if you look at a monthly basis , the price of this plan will cost you 333 rupees and you will get only 666 mb of data in 1 day per day , which can be said to be a bit expensive today .
but you will know that the validity of jio &apos;s 399 plan is 84 days and in this plan you get 1.5 gb 4g data everyday .
total 126 gb data is given , which is much more than 60 gb data of rs 999 .
not only this , calling is also unlimited in rs 399 plan .
however , the good thing about the rs 999 plan is that you can use 60 gb of data at any time while for rs 399 you can use only 1.5 gb of data in a day .
but when more data is needed , you can top up the data .
live plan for rs 1,999
this plan of long validity of jio is equally harmful .
the price of this plan of jio is rs 1,999 , in which you get validity of 180 days .
in this tariff plan , users get 125 gb high-speed 4g data .
at the same time , even after the 125 gb data limit is over , users will be able to use the data at 64 kbps speed . ￼ national calling , national roaming is free as well as 100 sms are given everyday . if you look at this on a monthly basis , you pay around rs 333 and you get 694 mb per day and about 41 gb of data per month , which is expensive .
these bulky phones will be launched in 2019
but reliance jio has a plan of rs 498 which comes with a validity of 91 days .
in this , you get 182 gb data in 91 days .
2 gb everyday and calling and roaming is also free in it .
yes , if you want a long validity plan , then you can take a pack of rs 1,699 , which is for the year .
live plan of rs 4,999
this plan is even more expensive .
the company has a price of rs 4,999 for this plan , which has a validity of almost a year , 360 days .
in this , users get 350 gb high-speed 4g data , after which the users can use unlimited data at 64 kbps speed .
this means you will get 1 gb of data almost every day and its month price will be rs 416 .
which will be called a bit expensive .
yes , the good thing is that you can use the whole data anytime . there is no cap .
but the pack of rs 1,699 for the year is very good and you can resort to top-up if you need more data .
you can handle your year-round mobile expenses in only half the fee .
jio recharge for rs 9,999
this plan of jio is the highest loss deal .
the price of this plan is rs 9,999 .
in the tariff , users will get 750 gb high-speed data with a validity of 360 days .
apart from calling , sms including roaming is also free .
but if you have a lot of data every day and if you recharge a monthly plan with 4 gb daily data which costs rs 509 , then you will still get cheaper .
it will cost you around 6,000 rupees in a year but you will get 1,344 gb 4g data .
national calling , roaming and sms are also free .

trai i.e. telecom regulatory authority of india has made a big change in cable and dth services in the country .
trai has given freedom to the users that there is no need to pay monthly fees by taking channels in the bundle , instead customers can choose their channels according to their choice and choice .
till now , where local cable operators and dth companies were given packs and monthly fee was fixed , now the general public will have to pay only those channels which they have chosen according to their choice .
trai has kept its new rules for implementation on december 31 .
if you also want to know which channels your dth and cable operator will provide at what cost , then we have given further details .
trai has ordered dth service and cable operators to follow the new rules from december 31 .
first of all , let us know when according to the new rule of trai , you only have to pay the money of the channel you want to watch .
every channel has a rate fix .
earlier , a monthly package was provided by cable operators and dth services and the consumer also had to pay the money for that package .
in this package , which channel is for which price and which channel is free , this information was never given to the users .
but now this will not happen .
now users can choose their favorite channel of their choice and consumers will not have to forcefully take the channel pack offered by dth and cable operators , but will be able to put their favorite channels in that pack on their own .
while consumers can choose the channel on their own , dth operators have also created a buffet of channels for the convenience of the users .
there will be different channels in this package which will be given to the users according to their price .
2018 : some technical memories you will not forget
talking about dth services , they have made a list in the format of different channels .
this package is according to the channel groups and also according to the categories of the channels .
for example , the zee network channel &apos;s separate package , the star channels &apos; separate package .
similarly , separate package of cartoon channels for children and separate package of movies , news , infotainment and sports channels .
these packages are also according to different regional languages .
videocon d2h has kept the minimum price of its a-la-cart channels at rs 150 .
it also includes hd channels of every category .
similarly , when talking about local cable network , den network has started its packs at rs 4 , which is up to rs 145 .
at the same time , the city cable operator has made packages for the convenience of its users even after the trai rules .
siti cable &apos;s package can be purchased from rs 52.2 to rs 166 .
let us tell you that according to the new rules of trai , a minimum fee of rs 130 will have to be paid every month on cable and dth .
for this 130 rupees fee , users will be given 100 channels .
while 26 channels will be from doordarshan in these 100 channels , 74 channels will be from private companies .
users will also be able to choose 74 private channels available in this pack .
the 74 channels they want to watch will appear on their tv .
significantly , these 74 channels will be free-to-air .
these are jio long validity plans , starting from rs 999
this fix price of each channel has been fixed after the new guide .
starting from 50 paise up to a maximum of 19 rupees .
the fee for installing new setup box and new cable connection has also been fixed at rs 350 for trai .
apart from these 74 free-to-air channels , users can also get other channels from their preferences which will be paid .
for more than 100 channels , customers will have to pay an additional channel fee which will add up to rs 130 .
let me tell you again that this additional channel fee will start from 50 paise and will run up to a maximum of 18 rupees .
the year 2018 is over now but all the good bad memories of this year will still be in your mind .
we often have accounts that have impacted our lives .
since we are talking about technology here , in the new phase of the year , we will mention the technology of last year which has made a deep impact on the people or the tech world .
in the year 2018 , many new technology came that forced people to talk about it .
we have further mentioned a similar technique .
1 . roleable tv screen
maybe a lot of you may not have heard of it yet .
but just a few days ago , korean company lg has introduced a tv screen whose screen turns round like paper and the whole tv comes in a small box .
you will be surprised to know that the company has filed a patent for this screen for mobile as well .
lg &apos;s roleble tv will be launched in 2019 and the company will display it to the public at the consumer electronic show ces 2019 to be held this month .
in 2018 , it is considered to be a big invention for the tech world .
before buying phone in 2019 , keep these five features in mind
2 . folding screen
the discussion of folding screen before rollable screen was not much in the year 2018 .
folding screen means a display that you can fold into two or three folds , like paper or cloth .
companies like samsung , huawei and lg are making such screens and samsung even showed foldable phones .
in 2019 , samsung &apos;s foldable screen can be introduced under the name galaxy f.
the foldable screen became a hot topic in 2018 and has given new hope to other display devices including mobiles , tablets , laptops and tvs .
3. flying bike
people often wondered if the car , bus and bike also started flying .
in the year 2018 , the fantasy of a car and bus not flying right became a reality .
it has been named the hover bike .
although many would say that it was before 2018 .
but i am discussing this bike in 2018 because now dubai police has started its training .
till now this bike was undergoing tests but now it has been worn with acidism .
hoverbikes will be inducted into the dubai police in 2020 .
dubbed police will catch traffic breakers , thieves and criminals .

4 . popup camera
this year , vivo launched the phone named galaxy nex .
its popup camera was very much discussed .
it was included by the company for the selfie camera .
this camera is not visible hidden in the body .
but as soon as you turn on the selfie , it comes out of the body .
such technology was first seen .
although the second phone has not been received yet , but in the year 2018 , it was very much discussed .
5 . slide out camera
the slide out camera was also in the news in 2018 after the pop-up camera .
companies such as oppo , honor and xiaomi launched phones with slide-out cameras .
6 . airdrop notch
it is important to mention the new notch trend if the screen is talked about .
in the year 2017 , apple introduced the notch screen but where there is a cut out at the top of the screen and around the entire body , the screens are visible at the top .
but in 2018 , companies like oppo and vivo started the airdrop notch .
in such a situation , there is a small notch like a drop of water in the middle of the screen , on which the selfie camera is given .
this screen made a lot of headlines this year .
7 . punch hole screen
by the end of 2018 , another new screen technology made headlines .
its name is punch hole display .
it was started by samsung .
at the same time under the punch hole , a hole is made in any side of the screen and a selfie camera is available on it .
it was started by samsung and now other companies have also joined this link .
recently , honor and huawei have featured a phone with a punch hole screen .
8 . dual display
the year 2018 saw the most innovation in screen technology .
after the notch and punch hole , the dual display attracted a lot .
nubia first introduced this phone and after that vivo told everyone about it .
however , some companies , including lg , have used the first two screens where there was a small screen above the screen .
but these phones use two big screens in the front and back and you can use the phone from both sides .
this big thing can be said .
more such phones can be seen in the new year .
9 . quad camera
earlier this year , huawei launched a 3-camera phone .
after this , samsung also removed a phone with 3 cameras .
but by the end of the year , samsung had brought four camera phones .
for the first time , a quad camera was used in a phone .
the most important thing is that there are different function sets on all four cameras which help you in better photography .
10 . 12 gb ram
today phones are capable of functioning like computers because of the excellent hardware .
but now the phone is starting to be more powerful than ordinary computer .
oneplus and vivo have launched 10 gb ram phones a few days ago .
at the same time , lenovo has moved ahead of them by introducing a phone with 12 gb ram .
the lenovo z5s with super fast processor and powerful ram is being talked about everywhere and this phone launched at the end of the year has gained a lot of headlines .
11 . in-display fingerprint scanner
after this , companies like oppo , oneplus and xiaomi used in-display fingerprints in their phones .
this year , this technique was very much discussed .
12 . 5 g
talking about 2018 and 5g is not mentioned , then everything will be incomplete .
although 5g could not come this year but 5g preparation has been completed and it will knock in the new year .
this year gsma set the standard for 5g , then companies immediately started working on 5g modems and processors .
in many countries , 5g spectrum has been fixed , many companies have also announced their 5g phone .
now the network is ready , modem and phone too .
so today we can say that in 2019 there will be 5g-5g .
13 . ecg
many innovations in mobile and other variables have been done so far , such as heart rate monitor , calorie counter and stress test , etc .
but this time apple has added ecg in its wearable which is considered very special .
now we can wish it on other devices as well .
ai
ai technology was very much discussed in the year 2018 .
it is also known as artificial intelligence .
people often use it in the camera , but now mobile manufacturers have created a special ai chip that takes data from your daily work and helps you all the time .
like where do you go at some point and what will be the best route , which app do you use and setting that first .
not only this , ai can also tell you which app to use at any given time .
the utility of ai will increase even more in the coming days .
14 . 48-megapixel camera
huawei has introduced the nova 4 handset in china .
it is the first phone in the world to be introduced with a 48-megapixel camera sensor .
the big megapixel camera has started in 2018 , which you will see even further .
15 . large aperture
not only more megapixels and more sensors , but a lot of hearing was also heard about the aperture in 2018 for good photography .
common people who till now only heard more about megapixels and flash in the camera , also got to hear a lot about aperture .
samsung revived the galaxy s 9 + and note 9 .
the company launched phones with variable apertures that you can adjust yourself or are large or small according to the light .
when you shop for a phone , the effort is to be the most advanced .
because if the technology is a bit old then you will be left behind .
because the mobile market changes very fast .
this is the reason why one thing is often said about the mobile world that every morning a new technology is born and the market changes in three months .
you can also feel the innovation and change in the mobile world .
when 2018 started , what kind of phones used to come and now when 2018 is coming to an end , how much the phones have changed .
glass is used in place of mattel in the design , now there is a demand for face unlock and in-display fingerprint scanner , not the rear fingerprint , the cameras also need two and 4g volte is necessary .
many more such changes have been observed .
now we are knocking in 2019 and this year too much new technology is going to knock which will change the feel of the phone .
if you are planning to purchase fons in the new year , then it is important to take care of some things so that even if the technology changes , you can stay updated for some time .
next we have mentioned 5 such important features for the phone in 2019 .
1 . 5 g
for the last one and a half years 5g has been buzzing .
at the same time , this service has also been available in some countries .
although there is no 5g phone yet , by march , many companies including samsung , xiaomi and oneplus are about to launch their 5g devices .
the talk of india is to auction 5g network in 2019 and by the end of this year companies like airtel and reliance jio can launch their service .
so if you are shopping for a phone in 2109 , then try to get a 5g phone so that when the network is launched , it is already 5g ready .
2 . android 9 pie
android 9 pie was launched in september last year .
but still most phones are launching on android 8.1 oreo .
but if you are shopping for a phone in 2019 then it is better if you do not take android oreo operating based phone .
you should take a 9 pie operating system based phone .
because even if you update the old operating system then 9 will come on the pie .
but if your phone is already running on the latest os , then when google android 10 is launched , it can be updated on it as well .
that is , you will be up to date .
3 . dual volte support
you must be thinking that a 4g is enough , what is the work of dual ? so let me tell you that most people in india use dual sim .
one for data and one for calling .
but service providers are going to gradually discontinue their 2g and 3g services .
the cost is very high due to 2g , 3g and 4g service and companies are going to reduce this cast .
now they will provide only 4g service and later upgrade the network to 5g .
in such a situation , if your phone supports 2g or 3g , then its services can also be stopped .
that &apos;s why it is better if you take dual volte .
you will get crystal clear voice on both networks .
4 . bokeh videos
in 2018 , images with bokeh effects were in the news .
but 2019 is going to be one step ahead of it .
this time there will be noise of videos with bokeh effect .
that is , with blur background you will be able to shoot videos .
so if you are buying a phone in 2019 , then definitely check out the bokeh video feature .
5 . fast charging
things like noch , water drop noch and punch hole noach etc. are currently happening and will remain in the coming days .
these features will now come in low-cost phones , so there is no need to think much about it .
yes , the battery in the phone is getting bigger and it takes a lot of time for charging .
in such a situation , if you are shopping for a phone in 2019 , then definitely check fast charging .
this feature will save a lot of time and you will see a lot of benefit during phone usage .

but the biggest drawback of this phone was that after taking a photo in the phone , it had to be connected to the computer to use it .
in november 2000 , the japanese company sharp j-sh 04 brought mobile phones .
this phone had a 0.11-megapixel camera .
learning of samsung &apos;s mistake in this sharp &apos;s phone , such technology was used , by which people could use it by looking at the photo in the phone itself .

first selfie
if you were to say that the first selfie of the world was made by someone , not deliberately , then would you be able to believe it ? reports state that the first selfie was posted by a student from australia on his 21st birthday , and the same was in a state of intoxication .
the incident was such that there were stitches on the lips of this boy named &apos; hopey &apos; on the internet .
and it just took a picture of itself and put it on the social platform to ask if it would dissolve quickly with repeated tongues on the stitches .
the game of selfie has started since then .

however , other mobile manufacturers also showed a new way in this phone and after this , intex informed about their 4g phones .
at the same time , micromax had announced that it will bring 4g phone with keypad bharat 1 and yesterday the company launched this phone in association with bsnl .
the company has also introduced an attractive plan with the phone .
after this launch everyone has the same question .
jiophone is better or micromax bharat 1 will be better .
we have already answered the same question .
phone specification
jiophone : reliance jiophone has been introduced on kai os and you will get a 2.4-inch screen .
along with this , the phone has 512 mb ram and 4 gb internal memory .
apart from this , there is a 2-megapixel rear camera and vga resolution front camera .
in jiophone you will get wifi , bluetooth and fm radio .
the phone has wifi for connectivity but you cannot use it like a wifi hotspot .
however it has tv connectivity feature where you can also connect your phone with old to old color tv through cable .
qualco mm showed 5g mobile processor with 1 gbps speed , mobile picture will change
bharat 1 : micromax is very similar to bharat 1 jiophone in terms of specification .
this phone has a 2.4-inch screen .
the company says that it uses android source code and will run android apps .
the phone has 512 mb ram and 4 gb internal memory .
there is also memory card support .
there is a 2-megapixel rear camera for photography and a vga resolution front camera .
wifi , bluetooth and fm radio will be available in the phone .
also you will get wifi hotspot which is not in jiophone .
just as jiophone has jiotv , it also has live tv .
but you will not get the tv connectivity feature .
yes , the special thing can be said that where jiophone is single sim , you will get dual sim support in micromax bharat 1 .
jiophone : during the launch of reliance jiophone , the company &apos;s md mukesh ambani had informed that this phone is completely free , but for this you will have to deposit a security amount of rs 1,500 .
this amount will be refunded after three years .
india 1 : this phone was priced at rs 2,200 .
the company has not kept any terms and conditions with the phone .
if you use with bsnl , you will get the benefit of special pack , while you can recharge ordinary plan with other operators .
the availability of jiophone in small quantity increases the difficulties of retailers , not everyone will get the phone till diwali
plan
jiophone : reliance has introduced a plan of rs 153 with jiophone .
with this recharge , you will get 0.5 gb 4g data every day with unlimited calling every month .
apart from this , sms is also free .
bharat 1 : as is known , micromax bharat 1 has been introduced with bsnl .
the company has launched a plan of rs 97 with this phone .
with this , you will get data with unlimited calls .
however , the company has not yet given information about the data limit .
terms and conditions
jiophone : as is known , with jiophone , you have been asked to deposit rs 1,500 as security money , which will be refunded after 3 years .
but the rule is that every year you have to recharge at least rs 1,500 .
after this , if you return the phone after 36 months , you will get a deposit of rs 1,500 fully .
but if you return after 2 years i.e. between 24 and 36 months , then jio will charge you 500 rupees and in return you will get back only rs 1,000 from security money .
similarly , if you return between the second year of the phone ie from the 12th month to the 24th month , then reliance jio will refund only rs 500 and will collect rs 1,000 from the security money .
india 1 : there is no condition for micromax bharat phones .
you have to pay rs.2,200 in the beginning and the phone is yours .
nobody will have any control over this .
if using with bsnl you will get the benefit of rs 97 plan , otherwise you can use it with other operators as well .
overall , micromax &apos;s india 1 looks much better in terms of plans and rules .
you do not have to bear the burden of the rule after taking the phone .
yes , you can definitely say that the price of the phone is 700 rupees more .
at the same time , it can also be said that currently bsnl does not have 4g service in india .
in such a situation , you have to use 3g .
hence reliance jiophone will be called better for 4g phones .
if you use the sim of other operators in india 1 , then the plan of 97 will not be available .
by the way , phones are available in the indian market even for 70 and 80 thousand rupees , but most people cannot spend that much money in phones .
not only this , there are many people who do not want to spend so much in mobile even if they have money .
they believe that there are many great phones available on a low budget that are capable of meeting all your needs .

many such devices have come or are going to come which you used to imagine earlier .
recently some similar techniques have come in our knowledge too .

4 . phone will charge by twisting hands
you will no longer need a power charger or power bank to charge the phone , but rather shake your hand and your phone will be charged .
a company called hand energy has developed a charger that will generate energy by rotating the hand and with this energy you can charge your phone .
it is a ball-like device that you have to rotate round and round with your hand .
with this , the special device installed in the device converts mechanical power into electricity .
it spins 5,000 revolutions per minute even when it is lightly rotated , which is capable of easily charging the 1,000 mah battery inside the device .
although this is currently a project .
5 . the phone will charge as soon as it is placed on the sticker
today , there is a phone in every charging slot in the house and it becomes difficult to charge the phone .
in such a situation , the french company energy square has found a special solution .
the company has invented the pad numa sticker so that you can charge more than one phone simultaneously .
the good thing can be said that it is not necessary that the phone has wireless charging support .
it is also able to easily charge phones without wireless charging .
putting the phone on this sticker will automatically start charging .
this charger is also completely neutralized by dust , water and wear and tear .

reliance jio may be behind many operators in terms of numbers , but the company has been the biggest in the discussion in just one year .
this company , providing free services and free voice calls and internet data at very low prices first , created a new record by adding 10 million subscribers in mahal 170 days .
other telecom companies have also had to drop their prices drastically due to the company &apos;s interest .
this is the reason why everyone is talking live today .
but let me tell you that if you are talking about jio , then it is very important to know these five things related to reliance jio service .
it can be said that information about these 5 things is necessary for every live user .
no unlimited calling
yes , of course unlimited voice calls are being given by reliance jio , but this is not completely true .
the voice calls given in jio &apos;s plans are limited .
jio users can make voice calls on any pack or plan for a maximum of 5 hours in a day .
that is , in 24 hours , only 5 hours of calls are received from a live number .
internet runs even after data runs out
reliance jio is the only network in the country that provides only 4g services for internet data .
the company has given a lot of data to the people at a low price .
at the same time , the special thing can be said that even if your 4g data runs out , the internet continues to run .
at the end of the data limit , it offers its services at a speed of 128 kbps where you can run services like whatsapp comfortably .
calling takes place even after the balance is over
this service of jio can be called the most special .
if your monthly plan has expired and you have not recharged , then calling from jiophone occurs .
though you cannot call on any other network , but a live to live call is connected , which can be called a very big thing .
the company provides this service under the gray period .
this service is not available on any other network .
free sms
along with voice calls to reliance jio , sms service is also being provided free of cost .
but in fact , limited has been retained by sms &apos;s jio .
jio users can only do 100 sms in a day .
let us tell you that this restriction on the services of reliance jio has been imposed based on the instructions of the indian telecom regulator authority of trai .
according to jio , the company &apos;s services should not be taken advantage of wrongly , so the company is following these instructions .
ringtone can be changed every minute
as we said earlier , jio has also been in discussion for services other than its 4g .
if you have a jio sim , you can change your caller tune every minute by downloading jio music in your phone .
you do not have to pay any fees .
while other operators charge a lot for this .
last year , xiaomi launched its flagship phone me mix .
although that phone could not be launched in india , but due to its design and look , it remained in great discussion .
people appreciated the full body badgeless display .
only after this phone , companies like samsung and apple have launched phones with backless display .
at the same time , xiaomi has launched me mix 2 , an upgraded version of mi mix .
this phone is also very stylish to watch and quite powerful too .
at the same time , it can be said that it has to be launched in india and it can come by next month .
but before launching in india , we have brought for you a special glimpse of this phone .
through this you can know everything about the phone .
there is no button anywhere on the front panel .
the rear panel is so bright that if you have this phone in your hand , then the mirror will not be needed .
in the rear panel , you will see the camera , flash and fingerprint sensor .
the power button and volume rocker are given on the right side of the phone .
on the left is the sim tray .
the lower panel has usb type c and loudspeaker while the upper panel has a voice cancellation .
however , you will be a little disappointed that this phone does not have audio and you have to rely on bluetooth headphones or usb connector .
xiaomi mi mix 2 has a 5.99-inch full hd display .
the display is very impressive and you can see that you will not find any empty space on the side .
there is no space at the top in this phone , so below the screen you will find a selfie camera .
you can see all the android buttons on the screen itself .
mi mix 2 has been introduced on the qualco mm snapdragon 835 chipset and has a 2.45 ghz octa-core processor .
it is currently one of the most powerful chipsets .
the internal memory of the phone we have was 256 gb and it has 6 gb ram memory .
this phone runs on android operating system 7.1 nougat and mi ui 9 is available in the phone .
wanted dual rear camera for photography but it has a 12-megapixel sony imx 386 sensor .
the quality of the camera is good but hoping for better .
you can see the sample photo from here .
the phone &apos;s selfie camera is just 5 megapixels .
there will be a big drawback here because when you take a selfie , your hand comes in front of the camera .
it was also very difficult to use selfie camera .
for power backup , it has a battery of 3,400 mah .
we got a good battery backup in a few days of usage .
this phone is expected to be launched around rs 40,000 in the indian market .
today , one year of reliance jio 4g service has been completed in india .
in this one year , perhaps more issues are discussed in the country than the company has discussed .
after the demonetisation , where there was a scarcity of cash in the country , even during that time , jio did not allow people to decrease their calling and data usage , but during that time also the data consumption data increased .
this was the magic of reliance jio .
the company started with free service and provided data at a low rate , after which people took it away .
after this , other operators also complained to jio for breaking the rules but regardless the company continued its services and became india &apos;s number one 4g service provider in a few months .
however , even though the free data service of jio has stopped , even today reliance jio 5 is offering such free service that other operators have not been able to do so far .
1 . free life time calling and sms
reliance jio &apos;s biggest achievement has been free calling .
during the launch of jio &apos;s 4g service , it was announced by reliance industries managing director mukesh ambani that the company will never charge money for calling , only you have to pay data charges .
lifetime calling is free on jio network .
even today , you can make unlimited calling from jio network , while other operators have also talked about unlimited calling but there is a cap in everyone &apos;s service .
frustrated with jio , companies like airtel and idea have talked about bringing volte service .
sms is also free in jio service .
one year of live : 12 months , 12 awesome
2 . free roaming
national roaming in jio is completely free .
by the way , other operators were talking about free roaming for the last several years but till date this has not been completed .
while you are a prepaid or postpaid user of jio , it doesn &apos;t matter that national roaming is completely free without any condition .
3 . free jiophone
nobody could have imagined that phones would ever be available for free and jio showed it by doing this .
reliance jio launched its 4g service and added more than 10 crore users within just 170 days .
at the same time , the jio phone has not even come for the cell and 60 lakh people have booked it and about one crore are waiting for prebooking right now .
when this phone will be available for cell then more and more people will join it , this service of jio has woken the sleep of other operators .
4 . free caller tune
probably very few people know that caller tune service is also free along with calling and roaming of jio .
other operators deduct up to 40 rupees for applying a caller tune for just one month for a month , but in jio you change your caller tune every minute . you will not have to pay any fee .
5 . free movie and song
apart from free calling , sms and tune , you may not know that you can watch movies and listen to songs for free from the jio app .
you can download songs offline .
the jio music and jio cinema app is available along with the my jio app .
although september 5 has always been a historic day in india , we celebrate this day as teachers &apos; day .
sarvepalli dr. radhakrishna was born the first vice president of india .
but something happened on this day in the year 2016 that the whole country would never want to forget .
especially the indian mobile world .
september 5 of 2016 proved to be a historic day for the indian mobile world when mukesh ambani &apos;s reliance jio made its indian mobile debut .
in just 12 months , not only the company touched many achievements but also changed the condition and direction of the entire mobile world .
the mobile consumer has got the most relief from the arrival of jio .
not only did the calling rate drastically decrease but the data charges also became the lowest in the world .
further , we have mentioned 12 such achievements achieved by reliance jio in 12 months .
1 . free life time calling
during the launch of reliance jio service , reliance industries managing director mukesh ambani had informed that lifetime calling is free on jio network and you never have to pay money for calling .
no operator has given this kind of service till date .
see the first glimpse of reliance jiophone in the video
talk of free roaming was happening from long time ago , but as soon as jio came , all types of local and national roaming were freed , which is a big achievement in itself .
3 . the first only 4g network
reliance jio is india &apos;s first mobile service provider offering only 4g services .
the company does not provide 2g and 3g services .
not only this , the company claims that jio network is 5g ready and the company can start 5g service soon .

4 . volte calling
although airtel first started 4g service in india and later other operators including vodafone also came but jio introduced volte service for the first time in india so that you can make high definition calls on mobile network .
5 . free 4g phone
for a time , you can still think about free calling , free data , but free calling itself has a unique history .
such efforts have not been seen anywhere and it was not easy to take such bold steps .
this is one of the biggest achievements of jio till date .
6 . number one in data use in the world
until jio &apos;s service came to india , the country was ranked 150 in the world in terms of data usage .
but on 5 september 2016 the company stepped in and became the world &apos;s number one country in just 90 days of data usage .
earlier india used to consume only 200 million gb of data , but today more than 120 million gb of data is consumed .
7 . 100 million users in 170 days
the company has demolished all records in terms of adding the fastest user .
made history by adding 10 million users in less than 170 days .
8 . 10 million app downloads
reliance jio &apos;s achievement is not just about calling and data , but the company has also won its app in apps .
my jio app became the first app in india to have more than 100 million downloads .
so far , no operator has downloaded more than 10 million app services .
9 . free caller tune
even if you find it a small thing to hear , after the free call and free data , you can not underestimate the caller tune service of jio .
where today other companies are charging up to rs 40 every month for this .
at the same time , even if you change the caller tune every minute for free , there is no charge .
10 . 7 users every second
you will be surprised to know that from its launch till february 2017 reliance jio was adding 7 users every second .
this is a record in itself .
no operator in the world has added users so fast .
11 . internet dongle market occupies more than 90 percent
you will be surprised to know that in just one year reliance jio occupied more than 91 % of the dongle market in india while operators like airtel , tata , vodafone and idea were in this field for many years .
12 . all services absolutely free for six months
however , talking about the biggest achievement of jio , the company has given all kinds of services free from its launch to six months .
such an attempt was not seen yet .
today a big debate is going on in india .
some people are talking about boycott of chinese goods and some are not concerned with it .
although the highest penetration of chinese goods is in the mobile world .
in such a situation , the matter of boycott of mobile is becoming the most .
although we are not going to debate here on the use and not the use of chinese goods , but trying to give relief to those people , good indian phones want to take them .

madras cafe . it feels strange to hear the name .
all kinds of things start revolving in the mind that what is going to be tried to show in this film that the name of the film is so different .
the passing of a few reels of madras cafe in front of the eyes is sure that this film is not only a wonderful experience according to the standards of hindi cinema , but also the best film of war and intelligence missions. is .
madras café , the backdrop of a two-decade-long civil war in sri lanka , is truly the first war film in hindi to be treated at several levels , keeping the indian government &apos;s confrontation with the ltte , one of the world &apos;s most feared terrorist organizations . shocked at
the seriousness of the subject of madras cafe does not surprise us so much as the depth of its subject is captured in the mind .
the script of the film , the screenplay , the dialogues and the payoff , the selection of actors for small roles , the simple style of the performance is all praiseworthy .
kamaljeet negi &apos;s camera captures in a brutal manner the photographs of the helplessness and inhuman treatment of the sri lankans surrounded by civil war .
there are repeated scenes of repeated massacres , scenes of indian soldiers encounters with terrorists , unsuccessful attempts to capture ltf ( actually ltte ) chief anna ( a character matching prabhakaran ) or a few moments of exodus . with the sound of hundreds of bullets , everything seems completely unheard and overlooked on the madras cafe table .
an honesty is seen in john &apos;s performance .
john will also have to be praised as the producer who took the risk for the film . in the small role of vikram &apos;s wife , ruby ( rashi khanna ) brings out her helplessness from time to time that even after her murder , the audience remembers her passionate face again and again along with vikram .
foreign war journalist jaya ( nargis fakri ) , who came to know the reality of sri lankan civil war , may not speak a single hindi dialogue in hindi and even though she looks on screen for a very short time like ruby , her investigative stories are deep on the whole issue make an impact . like &apos; hero &apos; john , nargis &apos; role also sits outside the grooves of the typical &apos; heroine &apos; .
the intricate story of madras cafe runs at the speed of the jet through the complex routes of many countries like india - sri lanka - uk - singapore .
the tension arising out of all the effort to prevent the assassination of the former prime minister of india ( rajiv gandhi , though the character is kept anonymous in the film ) at an election rally by adding all the intricate episodes of the story in a blistering manner also beats faster .
the entire daromdar director of madras cafe carries shoojit sarkar on his shoulders . the way shoojit handles this complex subject positively evokes a feeling of mistrust towards him .
even though shoojit has taken many artistic liberties in the film and some of the film &apos;s flaws may come to grips , but after the solid research , the documentary-drama-style madras cafe offers shoojit &apos;s ability .
director shoojit sarkar , who has proved himself from out of the box films like &apos; here &apos; in 2005 on kashmir problem and in 2012 comedy film &apos; vicky donor &apos; , has got himself from madras cafe among the selected directors , there is also a deep understanding of cinema and the ability to do something different . the madrafe cafe makes the cinema feel very different .

samsung wifi camera launched with special features
on wednesday , samsung launched its wb250 smart camera equipped with wi-fi technology .
the samsung galaxy s4 zoom is the world &apos;s first optic zoom cameraphone .
it is 8-inch , has quad core processor , storage is expandable and camera is also good .
these new devices will work on a quad core processor and will also have a front facing camera .
it has a dual core processor , an improved camera and a personal assistant siri .
in most cases , both are equal , but in terms of processor and ram , the nexus 4 looks ahead , so the galaxy s3 overtakes in terms of camera performance .
systems alumni has designed the world &apos;s first wireless technology microprocessors , 1 intestinal bullet camera , 1 stand alone , anti-ballistic missile defense system , major internet search engine , the largest reverse osmosis desalination plant in the world and much more .
in november 2007 , apple released final cut express 4 , which did not support real-time editing in it , though the avchd-format ( this was the only camera actually connected to the computer provided that apple transcoding the avchd to the intermediate codec ( aic ) this allowed for converting stored avchd files elsewhere and is currently only for intel processors )
who made cell phones , mp3 players , microprocessors , digital cameras and satellites ? electrical engineer ! electrical engineering ( e ) is one of the broadest of engineering disciplines .
your beautiful pen is also your computer ? a new american company , anoto , has recently released a pen in the market which itself boasts of a small digital camera , as well as a small processor ie computer itself .
we wait for the time when someone will direct us , why do we wait for someone else ? today , too much time has elapsed in these nonsense things and whatever i had to say has remained a trap .
i was talking about science and technical knowledge , i saw that on many science related websites it is being told that : now mobiles cannot be stolen with the help of mobile tracker .
20g in new blue disc b. there is more storage capacity than that .
now mobile processors in computers too , made it even more portable .
windows 4 supports 190g . b. even more ram .
nikon &apos;s new s.s. l. r. the camera is even more powerful for digital photography .
, . e.t.c .
and much more , is it all due to science , yes all of this was possible only because of science , but neither is this science , nor is there any such definition of science that can be said that these are the sciences .
definition of science : &quot; science is the real and special knowledge of an element or object &quot; .
if we look at the above subject keeping in mind the definition of science , can we say that these are the sciences : - the feature of mobile tracking we get from the software contained in it and not the subject of software engineering science .
increasing the storage capacity of blue disk is not science , but science is the study of chemical used in it .
if we want to write about science then we can describe the properties of chemical using which technical knowledge made blue disc .
by changing the material of the components of the computer processor and its mother board and using its properties , we made our computer more portable .
&quot; it is science to study any element from wariki and get real and special knowledge of it , and technical knowledge is the only way to develop new technology for your convenience by doing logical calculations of that particular knowledge &quot; .
the concept of science , god , is just now 5 years old , abhay , son of gulzar singh , has come , and even today he has the same moisture .
he is unable to forget his son even after longing , and how can anyone forget , what was his age , he was only 19-20 years old .
but today they realize their mistake and now they have started accepting themselves as responsible for their son &apos;s death .
5 years ago , when abhay got first place in his school in 10 + 2 , his father thought of making abhay an engineer and he came . i. t. sent to delhi to prepare for .
he had come home only once on vacation , when a monk came to his house to talk .
after this , gulzar singh also introduced abhay to that monk and asked about his future , but it has happened that these people have told something bad and never told him any preventive measures , he just went and asked this god continued to speak .
there was a time when it was said that whether we will get a job or not , when will the marriage take place .
cameras , great sound , lots of connections and they now come with an intel processor and lots of memory so the user experience is the best you can find in any computer , laptop or not .
the image processor offers dramatically improved speed of all camera operations for both intuitive operation and both fine detail and natural color reproduction .

iqoo is the newest smartphone brand to enter the indian market .
while most companies enter the new market with the intention of seizing the budget segment first , iqoo has come up in india with a different plan to the contrary .
the company made its debut in india with the iqoo 3 , which is a premium smartphone and comes with some robust hardware .
for example , the iku 3 includes qualco mm &apos;s most powerful processor snapdragon 865 .
not only this , the top-end model of iqoo 3 comes with 5g connectivity support .
however , this is currently only good for appearances , as 5g network is not available in india at this time .
the starting price of the smartphone is rs 36,990 and if you look at the specification on the paper of iqoo 3 , then this price does not feel much .
should you put your money on this new player ? we are reviewing the device to find out .
iqoo 3 design when we first saw iqoo 3 , we were very happy with its build .
with a weight of 214.5 grams , it certainly feels heavy , but also premium .
it has a 6.44-inch amoled display .
it has a small hole-punch cutout for the selfie camera .
there are extremely thin bezels around the display .
iqoo 3
the earpiece is set on the k frame , which is difficult to find at a glance .
the phone includes a metal frame , which gives the device a premium look .
the power and volume buttons are on the right side of the device and are set up very well .
it is not difficult to reach the thumb .
the power button comes in orange finish .
iqoo has also given capacitive shoulder buttons on the right side of the frame .
these are set in such a way that you can use them while keeping the phone in a landscape manner while gaming .
there is a smart button to the left of iqoo 3 which can be used to access google assistant .
this phone has a 3.5 mm audio jack on the top , while the bottom has usb type-c port and loudspeaker .
the rear panel of the device comes with corning gorilla glass 6 protection , which will protect the phone from minor scratches in everyday use .
iqoo has introduced this smartphone in a choice of three colors - tornado black , quantum silver and volkeno orange .
our review unit was of the tornado black variant color , but we liked the volcano orange finish quite a lot , because it looks different from the common color .
the aiku 3 has a quad-camera setup at the back .
the camera module looks similar to most smartphones nowadays .
the iqoo 3 has a 4,440 mah battery and the good thing is that the phone &apos;s box has a 55 watt &quot; super flashcharge &quot; charger , which helps in quick charging the device .
qualco mm snapdragon 865 chipset has been given in iqoo 3 specifications and software iku 3 .
it is by far the most powerful chipset in android smartphones , with one core operating at 2.8 ghz , three cores at 2.4 ghz and the other four cores operating at 1.8 ghz clock speed .
aiku has launched three variants of iqoo 3 in the indian market .
the base variant has 8 gb of ram and 128 gb of storage and is priced at rs 36,990 .
its second variant has 256 gb storage with 8 gb ram , which costs rs 39,990 .
the phone also has a 12 gb ram and 256 gb storage variant , which supports 5g .
its price in india is rs 44,990 .
all variants of iqoo 3 include ufs 3.1 storage and lpddr5 ram .
the smartphone features a 6.44-inch full-hd + amoled display , which comes with 409ppi pixel density and hdr10 + support .
the iqoo display features schott xensation up glass for safety and comes with a 91.4 percent screen-to-body ratio .
connectivity options on the iqoo 3 include 5g ( top variant only ) , dual 4g volte , bluetooth 5.1 , gps and glonass .
it has a 4,440 mah capacity battery , which supports 55 watts fast charging and also has a 55w super flashcharge charger in the phone box .
this charger has a pill-shaped 90-degree folded connector and iku claims that it allows charging the smartphone while gaming .
come into the software .
iqoo 3 comes with iqoo ui 1.0 based on android 10 .
we liked its user interface , as it is very easy to operate and is also simple to see .
aiku &apos;s ui does not have an app drawer and all icons appear on the home screen .
it does not hurt much when used with one hand .
there are many customization options available on iqoo .
you can choose different animations for lockscreen , fingerprint and facial recognition .
this phone also has an always-on display feature .
users also have the option to choose between a three-button navigation layout and swipe gestures .
this feature is convenient to use and iqoo has also added a quick launch gesture to it , which comes back to hold skype .
vivo &apos;s smart assistant jovi is also present on the device .
android 10 features such as digital wellbeing and parental control are also available .
iqoo 3 has a monster mode , which instantly increases cpu performance and turns off all power-saving options .
this feature also changes the theme of the smartphone .
it also has ultra game mode , which starts all the gaming features of the smartphone as soon as it is turned on .
aiku 3 comes with bloatware like hello , dailyhunt , flipkart , facebook , wps office , amazon shopping and opera .
the device also has its own app store , called v-appstore .
explain that if you launch apps like dailyhunt and hello , then spam notifications start coming .
if you do not want to use these apps then we would advise you to remove them .
iqoo 3 performance , battery life a 60hz refresh rate panel has been given in the display of the iku 3 .
nevertheless , its color production is very good .
the viewing angles of the panel are good and it performs quite well even in the sun .
there are three color modes to choose from and you can also tweak the color temperature .
the iqoo 3 display has a small hole-punch , but it won &apos;t disturb you while watching content .
however we were not happy with the iqoo 3 &apos;s loudspeaker .
it lacks stereo output and makes very little noise to our liking of the speaker .
along with the in-display fingerprint scanner , it also has face unlock feature , which is fast and accurate .
we did not see any kind of problem in it while playing apps or games .
because we had 12 gb ram variants , multitasking also felt like butter .
we saw pubg mobile and asphalt 9 : legends playing in it .
both games ran on high settings and we did not feel any kind of lag or frame skipping during the entire gaming .
we also tested the gaming trigger while playing pubg mobile .
we found this to be quite useful for pubs &apos; enthusiasts .
you will be happy to know that iqoo 3 gives good battery life .
in our hd video loop test , this phone managed to last 19 hours and 13 minutes .
with regular usage this phone can last about one and a half days without any problem .
in our charging test , the iqoo 3 took 30 minutes to charge 78 percent and took about 50 minutes to fully charge .
a five-minute short charge was able to deliver 16 percent of the smartphone which is impressive .
if some people compare it to realme x50 pro 5g , then tell that the phone takes less than iqoo 3 to be 100 percent charged , but the thing to note is that the realme phone comes with a 65w charger and it has 4,200 mah . has a small battery .
iqoo 3 cameras the ikoo 3 comes with a quad-camera module at the back , which reminds us of the vivo v17 .
the primary camera has a 48-megapixel sony imx582 sensor with f / 1.79 aperture and the secondary camera has a 13-megapixel telephoto sensor with f / 2.46 aperture , which supports 2x optical zoom and 20x digital zoom .
the other two cameras feature a 13-megapixel wide-angle lens with an f / 2.2 aperture and a 2-megapixel depth sensor with an f / 2.4 aperture .
the camera app is similar to the one found in vivo &apos;s smartphone .
the iqoo 3 &apos;s camera setup locks focus quickly and its ai can easily detect which subject the camera of the phone is looking to focus on .
apart from this , the camera also suggests which camera would be right to use for taking a particular shot .
in daylight , the smartphone captures the light correctly .
photos taken in broad daylight are good , but in some pictures the color tone faded slightly .
there is no lack of detail in most of the photos , after zooming in , photos are seen in grains ( fine grain ) .
switching to a wide-angle camera reduces the quality of photos and distortion appears at the edges .
we also saw that the color tone in the pictures also diverges slightly from the original .
the telephoto camera supports 2x optical zoom and , like the primary camera , it can take some good pictures .
close-up shots with the primary camera were good .
the smartphone creates a natural depth effect between the subject and the background .
you can also take macro shots with the iqoo 3 by switching to a wide-angle camera .
macro shots get good detail and iqoo 3 allows you to take pictures very close to the subject .
portrait shots are also good in the phone .
the phone gives you the option to set the level of blur before taking a shot , but there is a slight lack of detail compared to other smartphones in this price range .
in low light the camera &apos;s performance is average to fall and we also noticed a lack of detail in the photos .
switching to night mode makes only a small difference in photos .
however , the phone &apos;s camera performs a bit better in areas of light shade as opposed to full darkness .
the exposure with the detail in the photos is also good .
the selfie taken with the iq3 also looked better .
focus is fast and the smartphone applies beautification by default .
when shooting in light , the smartphone automatically enables hdr , which helps to deliver better output .
talking about video recording , it can record 4k video with a maximum of 60fps from the primary back camera and 1080p resolution at 60fps with a selfie camera .
in the daylight , we saw a slight flicker in the video .
it also has a super steady mode .
however , even after using it , there is a slight vibration in the video .
video footage is poor in low light , but the super steady mode improves the video to some extent .
verdict iqoo 3 is the first smartphone of this new brand in india and it comes with some powerful hardware .
the phone has snapdragon 865 chipset and also includes support for ufs 3.1 storage .
both these combinations appear in very few smartphones .
the phone also has a 5g connectivity variant , if you take the top variant and spend rs 44,990 .
however 5g networks are not available in india at the moment , so you can also choose the below variants without any worries .
however , in our review , we have tested only 5g variants with 12 gb ram .
iku 3 &apos;s software is good .
however , it gets better when the bloatware involved is removed .
however the camera felt lighter on several occasions .
apart from its camera performance , iqoo 3 did not give us a chance to complain .
redmi note 9 pro has been launched in india and is available at a starting price of rs 12,999 .
there are many interesting features in the smartphone , given that this price is going to affect a lot .
although there are many other mid-range smartphones available in the market at the moment , which are equipped with the best features at the same price .
two of these big names are realme 6 and samsung galaxy m30s .
xiaomi fans have had high expectations from the redney note series since the beginning , and at a time when mid-range smartphones are coming with flagship grade features , it is evident that fans of redmi note 9 pro will also have high expectations .
the 90 hz display included in the redmi note 9 series , fast charging technology such as battery charging quickly and high-resolution camera setup affect the low price .
however , many premium features of the series come in the high-end model redmi note 9 pro max .
here again , the question becomes whether the redmi note 9 pro will meet the expectations of the fans or not ? to find out the answer to this question , we have reviewed the redmi note 9 pro .
let &apos;s know together whether the redmi note 9 pro can be called the king of the mid-range segment .
redmi note 9 pro design redmi note 9 pro is definitely a heavy phone .
with 8.8 millimeter thickness and 209 grams weight , many users will feel this phone heavy .
the company says that the weight of this phone has been distributed in the entire body , due to which the users will not feel heavy .
we found it difficult to use it with one-handed but not impossible .
xiaomi has three colors , interstellar black , glacier white , and aurora blue .
you will not find any kind of pattern in it .
our aurora blue unit comes with a very shiny rear panel , which is bright and reflective .
thankfully , the rear panel is not very slippery , but as soon as you touch it , it easily catches fingerprints .
xiaomi has come up with a new camera bump design .
the flash is focused under four camera lenses .
it has a nice design touch , which makes it significantly different from the previous redmi note 8 series .
the redmi note 9 pro uses gorilla glass 5 at both the front and rear and its frame is made of polycarbonate .
the selfie camera included in the front is set in a hole-punch cutout .
interestingly , we saw that the picture of the redmi note 9 pro on its box cover actually showed a smaller hole-punch cutout than the device .
the next interesting point is the included side-mounted fingerprint sensor , which is set in the power button .
this is given on the right side of the phone , which works quite well with the thumb of our right hand .
if you are left-handed , you may find it inconvenient .
xiaomi says that the fingerprint sensor is given in the power button because it is faster than the in-display sensor and is more convenient than the fingerprint sensor on the back .
this is definitely new for smartphones in the budget segment .
the volume button is set awkwardly above the power button and is not easy to reach when making a call .
on the left side , a slot tray is provided for two nano-sims and a microsd card .
xiaomi &apos;s trademark infrared emitter is on the top of the phone and can be used to control many home devices .
there is a common usb type-c port , 3.5 millimeter audio socket , and speaker at the bottom .
many people will be happy to know that there is actually a hidden notification and charging led in the earpiece .
xiaomi has done quite well in terms of design and redmi note 9 pro gives a new feel without any major changes .
the phone also has p2i coating , which can protect it from water splashes .
although it is not completely waterproof .
redmi note 9 pro specifications and software the redmi note series phones usually have impressive specifications and xiaomi has given a bigger screen and battery on this phone than the previous model .
on the phone , you get a 6.67-inch full-hd + ( 1080x2400 pixels ) display , which has a large hole-punch for the front camera .
some fans may be disappointed that the high-refresh rate display running in the trend these days , the small company has given a standard refresh rate display .
redmi note 9 pro has a 60 hz display .
at the same time , realme 6 coming around this price
comes in 90 hz display .
xiaomi claims that there are many apps that can &apos;t take advantage of the high refresh rate and people can &apos;t really tell the difference between 60 hz and 90 hz .
the company says that the high refresh rate also affects the battery life .
we should also understand that some agreements in the price of rs 12,999 are not bad .
the phone has a 5020 mah capacity battery .
xiaomi claims that this battery can provide 29 hours of volte calling and 14 hours of gaming .
you get an 18w charger in the box , which charges the battery fast .
the snapdragon 720g is an advanced chipset coming with two high-performance 2.3 ghz cores and six energy-efficient 1.8 ghz cores , built on an 8nm process .
the 4 gb ram and 64 gb variants of the smartphone are priced at rs 12,999 and its 6 gb ram and 128 gb storage variant comes at rs 15,999 .
other highlights include standard gps , dual-band wi-fi ac , bluetooth 5 and other standard sensors with navic support .
the phone &apos;s box offers usb type-c cable with 18w charger and a sim ejector tool .
it also has a plastic case .
redmi note 9 pro includes miui 11 based on android 10 and in our review unit this phone was working on the february security patch .
sadly , this phone also comes with bloatware and is part of xiaomi &apos;s business strategy with promotional content .
the company says that users can remove or disable some of these services , but we still see a lot of spam notices in it .
there is no app drawer , but you get some level of ui customization .
swiping on the homescreen launches the mi browser which also helps you search for installed apps .
this is somewhat convenient but we want this shortcut to be customized for any other purpose .
the software includes all android 10 and miui 11 features .
redmi note 9 pro performance and battery life at this time , the hardware coming on the budget smartphone in the market also gives good performance in everyday use .
the mid-range redmi note 9 pro also makes it easy to do everything from basic calls to heavy 3d gaming without any hassle .
multitasking is also quite smooth .
if you want a smartphone with a high refresh rate display , then you may miss it in this phone , but most people will not really make much difference .
the redney note 9 pro is not an easy phone to use , as we have said .
the large screen in this phone works well for video and games , but the size and location of the camera bump makes it inconvenient to capture in a landscape manner when gaming .
holding it for long calls can also cause fatigue .
both the side-mounted fingerprint sensor and face recognition were fast and accurate in our experience .
the screen is bright and sharp .
the colors look good and if you want to change the color settings according to you , there are some presets available in the settings app .
we found the camera cutout a bit distracting when viewing the video-screen .
some apps are designed to hide the cutout at the top of the screen with a black band .
we were not very impressed with the speaker .
although the sound was loud , the ears were piercing .
pubg mobile runs by default on high graphics preset settings .
we played a few rounds for about 20 minutes and found that the redmi note 9 pro is slightly warm , contrary to what xiaomi claims .
the phone has never been inconvenient , but we did not want to play for very long .
however , there was no fluctuation in graphics and the gameplay was also good .
we were eager to test the battery of this phone .
with normal usage , we got a day and a half of easy backup in redmi note 9 pro , which is impressive .
during this time we played some games , streamed videos and took lots of photos and videos .
our hd loop video test lasted 16 hours , 2 minutes which is good but not as much as we were expecting .
given that some contestants in this segment may cross the 20-hour score .
redmi note 9 pro cameras the square camera bump on the back of the smartphone may also surprise some redmi note series fans .
the primary camera comes with 48-megapixel resolution , which has an aperture f / 1.79 and comes with the new samsung isocell gm2 sensor .
the camera setup includes an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with a 2-megapixel depth sensor and a 5-megapixel macro lens .
xiaomi has claimed to have an improved night mode , super phase detection autofocus and a special color profile for indians .
video can be recorded at 4k resolution with 30fps or 1080 pixels with 60fps .
slow-motion recording of 720p resolution can be done at 960fps .
in this you can also shoot video using a macro camera .
the front camera has a 16-megapixel resolution sensor .
this camera can produce slow-motion video up to 120fps .
ai beautification feature is also provided , which is on by default .
we found the primary camera good , but it cannot be said to be different in terms of quality .
the close-up looked good and the detail of the subject was also clearly visible .
if sufficient lighting and textures are not too complicated , the distant subjects are also well captured .
the wide-angle camera isn &apos;t too bad , but the quality definitely falls short .
despite promising distortion correction , some curved effects still appear on the edges of the frame .
the 5-megapixel macro camera offers far higher quality shots than most other macro cameras .
however , many of our shots came with dull colors and poor exposure at times .
at night we found the redmi note 9 pro &apos;s primary camera good in artificial light .
but in low light the camera compromised with the quality .
the wide-angle camera also did not produce good pictures , but in low light we did not expect much from it .
night mode was surprisingly ineffective .
it certainly added brightness to low-light photos , but did nothing with the subject taken in the dark .
night modes often included in other phones increase the detail , sharpness and quality of the subject in a shot taken in the dark .
the front camera works well in the day as well as at night , but we did not like its beautification mode , which makes the faces look artificial .
however the details in the photos are good at day as well as at night and the background is well blurred in portrait shots .
according to the price of redmi note 9 pro , its base variant is a good choice , especially for its features and performance .
however , this phone seems to be more an upgrade of the redmi note 8 than the redmi note 8 pro .
we like the style of redmi note 9 pro .
the specifications of the phone are very impressive and we had very few complaints during the use of this phone in day to day tasks as well as general entertainment .
the primary camera disappoints us a bit , especially in low light .
we found this phone a bit too heavy to our liking .
xiaomi has also launched redmi note 9 pro max , a high-end model of the series , starting at 14,999 and it gives you better front and rear camera setup , more ram , and faster charging features .
the high-end variant of the redmi note 9 pro is priced at rs 15,999 .
this price set by the company definitely confuses customers a lot .
while the high-end variant of the redni note 9 pro costs rs 15,999 , the base variant of the redmi note 9 pro max phone equipped with better hardware and features is priced at rs 14,999 .
so if you talk about the 4 gb ram and 64 gb storage variants of redmi note 9 pro , then at the price of rs 12,999 , this is undoubtedly a good option , but if we talk about 6 gb ram and 128 gb storage variants , then we should buy it seems a useless decision .
we hope that xiaomi will improve the camera through software updates .
if this happens then it can be very difficult to defeat this phone .
the company &apos;s budget redmi series has a huge hand behind xiaomi &apos;s popularity and immense success .
the company is constantly making its budget phones equipped with new modern features and the thing that impresses is that the price of these phones is also being kept to a great extent .
a big and popular series of redmi is the &apos; redmi note series &apos; , which comes equipped with hardware features like low price , great camera , big battery , high-quality screen .
the new member of the same series is redmi note 9 pro , which has recently launched .
there is no doubt that xiaomi fans were eagerly waiting for this phone .
it is obvious that the company had introduced the redmi note 8 pro with many major changes compared to the redmi note 7 pro , and now the fans will also want to know how much xiaomi redmi note 9 pro compared to the redmi note 8 pro has introduced major changes .
at this time , the redmi note 9 pro in the market will get a direct competition from realme 6 series and samsung &apos;s latest m-series , which are not much different from redmi note 9 in terms of specifications and features .
in this case , instead of finding a small specification difference between the redmi note 9 pro and its rivals , we have to see how much better the new phone is in the form of a full package at a lower price .
let us first start with the design of redmi note 9 pro .
xiaomi
has launched this phone with its &apos; aura balance &apos; design style , which has a simple and plain finish this time by removing the pattern and gradient finish .
the square camera module is provided in the back of the phone , in which the flash is also set .
in the middle is the redmi logo in the middle .
according to xiaomi , the weight of the phone is divided equally , so that it does not feel heavy in the hand .
the redmi note 9 pro is offered in aurora blue , interstellar black and glacier white color options .
its finish is quite shiny and reflective .
even our aurora blue unit looks brighter than the picture shown in the box .
this finish easily captures fingerprints .
the frame of the phone is made of polycarbonate .
overall , the redmi note 9 pro is a premium feel .
however , the device is not comfortable to hold and use .
the phone is 8.8 millimeters thick and weighs 209 grams , which is undoubtedly heavy .
the good thing is that the back of the phone is not very slippery .
gorilla glass 5 protection has been given on the front and back of this phone .
its large size and high weight is largely attributed to the 6.67-inch screen it incorporates and the 5020 mah capacity battery .
this is the largest screen and battery in the redmi note series so far .
xiaomi has used a 60 hz 1080x2400 pixels ips lcd panel on the phone , which is a bit surprising as the competitors are emphasizing high refresh rates at the moment .
xiaomi told gadgets360 that this is a non-essential feature , which many people may not even realize .
the qualco mm snapdragon 720g processor is not high-end .
here xiaomi and realme have adopted different paths , it will be quite interesting to find the difference between the two .
we will find out this in the review of redmi note 9 pro .
the front camera is set to the hole-punch on the phone &apos;s screen .
this cutout is placed in the middle of the display and is undoubtedly quite large .
there is also a fingerprint sensor in the power button on the right side of the phone , which some left-handed users will definitely not like .
the volume buttons are placed above the power button .
it is difficult to easily reach the thumb while holding the volume button .
at the bottom you get a usb type-c port , speaker and 3.5 mm audio socket .
the tray on the left has two nano-sims as well as a microsd card .
xiaomi &apos;s trademark infrared emitter is given at the top .
come to the hardware specification .
xiaomi says that the new snapdragon 720g processor works well and is a much better upgrade than the 600-series snapdragon chipset .
you can buy redmi note 9 pro with 4 gb ram and 64 gb storage for rs 12,999 .
its high-end variant comes with 6 gb ram and 128 gb storage , which costs rs 15,999 .
you get an 18 watt charger in the box and also supports the redmi note 9 pro standard usb power delivery charger .
another interesting thing is that the phone supports the indian navic satellite navigation system .
apart from this , the phone comes with wi-fi ac and bluetooth 5 , miui 11 based on android 10 .
xiaomi redmi note 9 pro comes with a 48-megapixel primary rear camera , using the new samsung isocell gm2 sensor .
the company says that it has made changes in the color profile of this sensor for indian users .
this camera has f / 1.79 aperture and can record 960fps slow-motion video as well as 4k 30fps video .
the other three cameras have an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera , a 5-megapixel macro camera , and a 2-megapixel depth sensor .

there is electronic stabilization for the front and rear cameras , a 21 : 9 aspect ratio option and a pro color option to enhance contrast and saturation .
according to all these features and price , this phone feels like a great deal and we can understand why xiaomi has ignored some of the features that other brands offer in their phones .
if you feel a bit lacking in this phone , xiaomi has also launched the redmi note 9 pro max with this phone in the market , which is almost identical , but you will get a 64-megapixel rear camera , 32-megapixel front the camera offers 33w fast charging ( including charger ) and more ram .

realme started the year with some new models in the budget segment and an all-new 5g capable flagship .
now the company has launched the upgrade series of realme 5 series , which includes realme 6 and realme 6 pro .
realme 6 is the affordable phone of this series , which has a hole-punch display with a 90hz refresh rate .
this is reality &apos;s first budget device , using a high-refresh rate display .
even at this price , mobile with 90hz display is not available in the market .
the phone comes with a powerful mediatek helio g90t chipset , which was earlier the redmi note 8 pro
has been seen in
however , here the price of this phone has surprised us a bit .
the initial price of realme 6 in india is rs . 12,999 .
the phone has a slightly higher price , but will the phone be able to impress us with its features to prove this price to be a reasonable price ? to know this , we have reviewed realme 6 .
is this the best budget smartphone you should buy without waiting ? let &apos;s know .
realme 6 design instead of the sunrise design offered on its low cost model , realme has given a new comet design to this phone .
realme 6 has a gradient finish at the back , in which the streaks are seen when the lights are out .
all these lines start from the top and gather like a nozzle at the charging port below .
overall , it gives the phone a premium look .
realme 6 has a 6.5-inch display , which is similar to realme 5 .
however , the new phone does not have a notch .
instead , the company has given a holistic punch design this time in fashion .
it is on the left corner of the hole-punch cutout display .
the side of the display has thin bezels , but the chin below is quite thick .
the edges of reality 6 are rounded so that it doesn &apos;t prick your palm .
the back of the phone is slightly curved which makes it comfortable to hold .
this time realme has opted for a side-mounted fingerprint scanner in the budget phone , which is located on the right side of the device .
we liked the placement , as the thumb reaches the power button / fingerprint sensor quite comfortably while holding the smartphone in the right hand .
if you are accustomed to using the phone with the left hand , then you may have to register your left hand finger and thumb to unlock the smartphone .
reality has set the volume buttons to the left and placed them slightly down which makes them easier to press .
the sim tray is just above the volume button .
we saw that the phone comes with 9.6 mm thickness , which feels really thick .
the phone has a 4,300 mah battery .
this phone weighs 191 grams .
usb type-c port is given below in realme phone .
there is also a 3.5  mm headphone jack and a loudspeaker grill with type-c port .
like most recently launched popular smartphones in the market , realme 6 has a quad camera setup in the back .
the module is slightly wider and embossed , but has a metal outline around it , which we hope can protect the module from scratches .
the rear panel of the phone is not made of glass , so there may be minor scratches in it .
reality has given a transparent case in the box .
you can use this case to protect against minor scratches .
realme 6 specifications and software realme 6 has a 6.5-inch full-hd + display , which was not in the previous model .
the highlight of the display is the included 90hz refresh rate .
high-refresh rate enhances your experience .
the company has set this refresh rate to auto , which sets the phone itself between 60 hz and 90 hz , but if you want to set its refresh rate according to you , then you also have that option available .
the display has a density of 405 ppi and realme 6 &apos;s screen-to-body ratio is 90.5 percent due to hole-punch .
gorilla glass 3 has been given in the front for display protection , which is undoubtedly a little old technology .
reality 6 has been launched with the mediatek helio g90t processor .
this is a powerful chipset , which we have seen in xiaomi redmi note 8 pro .
this processor has two cortex-a76 cores with 2.05 ghz clock speed and six cores with 2.0 ghz clock speed .
the reality phone comes in three variants .
its 4 gb ram + 64 gb storage costs rs 12,999 .
the price of 6 gb ram + 128 gb storage variants and 8 gb ram + 128 gb storage variants are rs 14,999 and rs 15,999 respectively .
the smartphone comes with ufs 2.1 storage .
we have reviewed the 8 gb ram variants of this phone .
in terms of connectivity , this phone offers bluetooth 5 , dual-band wi-fi ac and three navigation systems .
it is a dual-sim device that includes support for volte with 4g .
it includes all common sensors .
talking about the software , realme has given its realme ui instead of coloros custom skin with some changes .
the new realme ui is based on android 10 .
our device was running on the february security patch .
the user interface gives a somewhat stock android experience and we found it easy to use .
the settings app is well designed and we didn &apos;t have to struggle to find an option .
reality ui also comes with features such as digital wellbeing , focus mode , dark mode and riding mode .
reality comes with dual-mode audio , which allows you to simultaneously connect a bluetooth and wired headset for music on a smartphone , but this feature is currently listed under realme lab .
we also found some pre-installed i apps on the device , such as facebook , dailyhunt , gaana , hello , opera news , uc browser , wps office and some google apps .
it also comes with some reality apps already , such as the reality store , community , game center , game space , and its own apps store , called app market .
stock applications such as browsers continue to provide notifications , which we had to disable and disable .
realme 6 performance and battery life is undoubtedly interesting in the specification of realme 6 .
the 90hz refresh rate in the phone makes the interface very smooth .
we found the display a bit reflective in sunlight , but the panel was bright enough , so that we didn &apos;t have trouble viewing the content in the display .
we also liked its viewing angle .
realme 6 has a side-mounted fingerprint scanner , which means that the fingerprint sensor is also set on its power button .
it is capable of unlocking the phone with accuracy and speed and we liked its performance a lot .
we also set up face recognition , which recognizes the face and onlocks the phone .
this feature also unlocks the phone very fast .
unlocking the smartphone requires very little effort after enabling the wake-to-wake feature included in the phone .
we were happy with the performance of reality 6 , as we never had to wait long for the apps to load .
with 8 gb of ram on the device , it does not let apps kill in the background and you can multitask easily in it .
it also takes very less time to load the app .
mediatek has introduced the helio g90 series as a gaming processor and we were curious to see how reality 6 would perform in terms of gaming .
we played pubg mobile on a smartphone and it defaulted to high-settings and high frame rates with graphics set to hd .
we did not see any lag or frame drop while playing the game in these settings .
after about 20 minutes we notice that the smartphone gets a little hot on the touch .
the battery life of realme 6 is quite good .
it managed to run for 19 hours , 26 minutes in our hd video loop test .
with our usage , reality 6 lasted one and a half days on one charge .
the box comes with a 30w fast charger .
in using it , the phone charges up to 65 percent in 30 minutes and takes more than an hour to fully charge .
realme 6 cameras reality 6 has a 64-megapixel primary camera in the back .
also , this back camera setup features an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with a 119-degree field of view , a 2-megapixel monochrome camera , and a 2-megapixel macro lens .
the front has a 16-megapixel selfie shooter .
camera software is largely like other mid-range smartphones .
we had no problem switching to different shooting modes in the camera app .
quick toggles are provided for hdr , filters and chroma boost .
ai discovers the scene .
realme 6 is quick to focus and measures the light properly in most scenes .
in broad daylight , the camera of the phone takes some good shots and even when zoomed , there was no lack of detail in the photos .
in bright scene , the hdr mode of reality 6 is enabled by itself .
photos come to 16 megapixels by default , but you can take pictures by turning on the 64-megapixel mode if you wish .
there is also a wide-angle camera on reality 6 .
however , compared to the primary camera , this camera is not as good in dynamic range .
photographs can capture a much larger area , but there is a lack of detail and quality in the pictures taken .
apart from this , the edges of the picture also get slightly distorted .
for close-up , realme 6 also has a depth sensor , which blurs the background nicely .
the camera sets focus quickly , due to which the pictures are good .
portrait mode also gives you the option to set the level of blur before taking a shot .
the camera accurately detects the age of the subject .
macro camera lacks autofocus but you can easily take a picture by reaching very close to a subject .
it managed to take good shots while shooting indoors .
camera quality decreases slightly in low light .
you will get some good looking pictures even in low light , but there is a lack of detail in the photos when zoomed .
night mode works much better in low light and gives a great output by combining multiple frames together .
the detail also appears in pictures taken with night mode .
the selfie shot with realme 6 also had good details .
however , beautification is enabled by default .
for natural-looking output , you must reduce or turn off the beautification .
these pictures were good for sharing on social media .
recording at 4k resolution can be done from primary camera and 1080 pixels from selfie camera .
apart from this , the primary camera allows users to record 1080p with 60 frames per second .
videos are stable at 1080p resolution , but not at 4k .
we also see mild flickering effects in videos taken in low light .
realme has once again given a great smartphone at a reasonable price .
realme 6 comes with a powerful processor , gives good battery life , and also comes with a 30w fast charger in the box .
the company has also improved the realme ui , but we want the company to reduce bloatware ( unwanted apps ) in the future .
if you are looking for a value for money device priced at rs 15,000 or so , then you can get xiaomi &apos;s redmi note 9 series .
can wait for some time for the launch of .
however , we believe that you will also be satisfied with reality 6 .
the samsung galaxy m series has gained a lot of popularity for its affordable prices and good hardware .
samsung has succeeded in reducing prices by selling all models of this series online , reducing distribution costs .
the samsung galaxy m30 , which comes in the sub-15,000 segment , is one of the smartphones to further the success of this series and this may be the reason why the company later introduced a better version of this phone as the galaxy m30s .
now the company has launched a new upgrade version of these two phones in the market called galaxy m31 , which comes with some upgrades compared to both of its previous versions .
in this phone you get a quad-camera setup .
however , the processor and battery capacity have not been changed .
will this latest galaxy phone be enough to keep the galaxy-m series competitive in the market ? we have reviewed the galaxy m31 to find out .
you also know
samsung galaxy m31 design samsung galaxy m30s at first glance
and galaxy m31
it is difficult to distinguish between .
both smartphones feature a 6.4-inch display with waterdrop style notch , which samsung calls the infinity-u display .
its bezels are not thin , but cannot be expected much more according to the price .
samsung like other m-series smartphones
the body of the galaxy m31 has been made using plastic .
the earpiece is quite thin and is set in the frame just above the display .
the galaxy m31 feels comfortable to hold in the hand .
its sides are slightly curved , which makes the phone &apos;s grip good .
samsung has given power and volume buttons on the right side of the device .
thumb access to the power button is easy , but the volume button could have been set better .
on the left is the sim tray which was not closing well in our review unit .
the galaxy m31 has 3.5 mm headphone jack , primary microphone , usb type-c port and speaker all options are set below .
only the secondary microphone is given on its upper side .
when you look at the galaxy m31 from the back , you will definitely see some changes .
the camera module is similar to the galaxy m30 , but now comes with an additional fourth camera .
there is a fingerprint scanner with the module .
after holding the smartphone in hand , the fingerprint reaches this fingerprint comfortably .
the samsung galaxy m31 has a large 6,000 mah battery and weighs 191 grams .
having a larger battery definitely makes the device feel heavier .
samsung has also given a 15w charger in the box , which charges the battery a bit faster than the standard charger .
the company has introduced the galaxy m31 in two colors - ocean blue and space black .
we had the space black variant for review , which captures fingerprints very easily .
samsung galaxy m31 specifications , features the galaxy a31 specification is very similar to the galaxy m30 .
the smartphone comes with a 6.4-inch amoled display , which has a full-hd + resolution .
it also has corning gorilla glass 3 for protection , which protects the galaxy phone from scratches .
the display has good viewing angles and it also performs well in outdoor light .
samsung has also retained the exynos 9611 chipset included in the galaxy m30s in this phone .
it is an octa-core processor , with four arm cortex-a73 cores , with a maximum clock speed of 2.3 ghz and four cortex-a53 cores with a maximum clock speed of 1.7 ghz .
for graphics , it has a mali-g72 gpu .
you get options of 6 gb ram + 64 gb storage variants and 6 gb ram + 128 gb storage variants in the phone .
these two are priced at rs 15,999 and rs 16,999 respectively .
however , samsung has been offering a discount of rs 1,000 for some time in this phone , after which their price becomes rs 14,999 and rs 15,999 respectively .
currently , the validity of this offer has not been given .
the galaxy m31 has two nano-sim slots and includes support for 4g as well as volte .
it also supports wi-fi , bluetooth and gps .
its storage can be increased to 512 gb via microsd card .
talking about the software , the phone has given one ui 2.0 based on android 10 .
the software is exactly the same as we have seen in the recently launched galaxy s10 lite and galaxy note 10 lite .
we also get some unwanted apps like galaxy m31 .
apart from google apps on the smartphone , netflix , facebook , candy crush saga and samsung max came pre-installed .
the phone also has samsung &apos;s own apps .
these include my galaxy and samsung shop .
we found that my galaxy is an annoying app , as it sends many notifications throughout the day .
we would advise you to be careful while setting up the device .
during setup , samsung asks for some permission from you .
here you have to take a little care , because according to these permissions samsung will also send you marketing notifications .
in the setup process you will also be given the option to install some apps , which we would suggest to leave .
the galaxy m31 also offers android 10 features such as dark mode and focus mode , which can be enabled very easily through the notification shade .
dolby atmos is also available , but it only works with earphones .
digital wellbeing and parental control are also present on the device .
apart from this , the galaxy m31 also comes with common gestures like double tap to wake , gesture screenshots .
samsung galaxy m31 performance and battery life samsung has given 6 gb ram in galaxy m31 , which is quite useful while multitasking .
we did not find any kind of lag while using the smartphone .
the device loads apps quite fast , but large apps take a little time .
multitasking in the galaxy m31 is quite easy due to the high ram .
the fingerprint scanner unlocks the smartphone fast and the selfie camera also performs facial recognition with ease and accuracy .
we enjoyed watching the content on the amoled display .
with widewine l1 support , you can stream full-hd content in it comfortably .
we also played a pubg mobile game on the galaxy m31 and the game ran in high-graphics settings with hd resolution by default .
there was no difficulty in playing the game in these settings .
after playing for 20 minutes , we saw a four percent drop in battery .
apart from this , there was a slight warmth in the device , but it was not much .
the large battery will give you a chance to play for a long time .
in our hd video loop test , this phone lasted 22 hours , 31 minutes .
with our use the battery lasted for two days without any problems .
if strong battery life is important to you , the galaxy m31 certainly won &apos;t disappoint you .
samsung galaxy m31 cameras the galaxy m31 has a quad-camera setup at the rear and a 32-megapixel selfie camera at the front .
the galaxy m31 &apos;s back camera setup has a 64-megapixel primary camera sensor , which comes with f / 1.8 aperture .
this camera takes 16-megapixel bin shots by default , but you can easily switch to full resolution .
the setup also features an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera lens with a 123-degree field of view , which has an aperture f / 2.2 .
the other two cameras come with a 5-megapixel depth sensor and a 5-megapixel macro lens .
samsung &apos;s camera app is the same as before .
it is easy to use and it is also easy to access all the features included .
there is an option to switch between primary and wide-angle cameras .
the scene optimizer is capable of detecting scenes and setting the camera accordingly .
we found that the galaxy m31 locks focus on objects easily .
the photos came out well and there is no lack of detailing in it .
the smartphone enables hdr when needed .
switching to wide-angle camera is easy and you can capture more area than standard in the camera frame .
although the pictures taken from it look good , but when zooming , they show lack of detail .
wide-angle shots also have a rounded effect on the edges .
the galaxy m31 separates the subject and background well during close-up shooting and gives a natural blur effect .
however , we realized that the brighter colors appear more brighter in it .
the macro camera also takes good shots , but the camera quality deteriorates in low light indoors .
portrait shots are good and the camera app gives you the option to set the blur effect before taking a shot .
the edge detection of the camera is also very good and the galaxy m31 does a good job of separating objects from the background .
in low light the galaxy m31 takes longer to lock focus , so you have to keep the phone stable while taking shots .
photos taken in low light look good , but when zoomed in , you will see a grain effect .
however , this effect can be reduced slightly through night mode .
the selfie taken with the galaxy m31 is also good .
although it performs well in adequate light , the quality drops completely in low light and the selfie also shows a grain effect .
video recording can be done in 4k resolution through both the main rear camera and selfie shooter .
the galaxy m31 gives good recording output during the day .
however we found the footage to be a bit shaky .
it has a super steady mode which uses wide-angle-camera and reduces vibration slightly .
we got fairly stable output using this mode , but lacked the detail in the video .
if you make video in 4k you will not get any type of stabilization feature .
samsung has seen good success with the galaxy m30s , which may be one reason why the company did not make much major changes to this phone .
the company upgraded the ram to the phone earlier than before and added an additional back camera to add a quad rear camera setup .
apart from this , it gave preloaded android 10 .
the galaxy m31 may not feel like a completely new device .
it can largely be seen as a small update to the galaxy m30s .
the phone includes an exynos 9611 chipset capable processor , but we would have been more happy if this phone had a more powerful processor to increase the competition .
certainly some upgrades make this phone a bit better , but it cannot be called a big upgrade compared to the previous smartphone .
the strong battery backup of the phone is still the highlight of this series .
the phone can be easily run for two days in one charge , which competitive phones present in this price cannot easily .
redmi note 8 pro and realme x2
still giving you extremely powerful hardware for the price , but if you don &apos;t care about the benchmark score and just want a device that comfortably covers the bare needs and comes with a tremendous battery , then the galaxy m31 is your is a good choice for
realme has started quite aggressively in 2020 .
the company started its year with its budget smartphone realme c3
with the launch of the company and now the company is making its place in the premium segment with the new x50 pro .
this phone was to be launched at the mobile world congress trade show , but after the cancellation of mwc 2020 , realme decided to launch the phone in india .
reality x50 pro 5g
it is the company &apos;s most premium ( and most expensive ) phone yet .
one reason for this is the inclusion of the latest and most powerful mobile chipset snapdragon 865 in the phone .
make this phone you strong realme x2 pro
as well .
the x50 pro is equipped with some great features compared to the x2 pro .
it includes features like 5g support , a bigger battery , faster charging , dual front camera and new software .
we have not spent enough time with the phone , yet we are sharing with you our initial thoughts about realme x50 pro .
realme has not made much changes in the design of the x50 pro .
the company has introduced some minor improvements to the x50 pro 5g .
the most noticeable change in this is the included hole-punch display in the phone , which looks as premium as other hole-punch display phones available in the market nowadays .
this is a dual-hole display , as we have seen on samsung galaxy s10 +
i saw
however it is given in the upper left corner of the hole-punch display .
we found that this hole-punch does not distract you while watching videos or playing games .
the display is also curved at the edges .
the phone is very well built and feels strong .
protection of gorilla glass 5 is provided at the front and back .
the reality x50 pro has a 6.44-inch amoled panel bright and with full-hd + resolution , everything looks sharp .
like realme x2 pro , it also has a 90 hz refresh rate support .
the company has launched realme x50 pro 5g in two color options , including moss green and rust red .
both colors are not very bright .
realme says that now similar colors are popular among the youth .
mate finish is seen in the back of the phone .
we liked this finish very much and the good thing is that fingerprints are not easily visible in it .
although the back of the phone is very slippery .
the reality x50 pro 5g does not have a headphone socket or slot for a microsd card .
two nano-sim cards can be used in this .
you get dolby atmos audio , and stereo speakers with common power and volume buttons .
the rear camera bump in the phone also does not come with much bulge which we have seen before on realme phones , but this is because the overall thickness of the phone has been increased .
the total thickness of the reality x50 pro is 8.9 millimeters , which feels quite thick in the hand and weighs 205 grams , which is of course heavier .
one of the main attractions of the phone is the qualco mm snapdragon 865 processor .
we are going to see this processor in many flagship android phones this year .
the main reason for this is that the chipset comes with 5g network support .
although currently users in india cannot use this feature , as 5g connectivity is not available in the country at the moment , but of course this makes this phone a good option for the future .
also , if you go to countries with 5g network then you will get plenty of opportunity to take advantage of high speed data there .
the top model of realme x50 pro 5g includes 12 gb lpddr5 ram and 256 gb ufs 3.0 storage , which we are testing .
talking about the price of all the variants , the phone &apos;s 6 gb ram and 128 gb storage variant is available for rs 37,999 , 8 gb ram and 128 gb storage variants at rs 39,999 and 12 gb ram and 256 gb storage variants at a price of rs 44,999 .
realme says that it has also used the vapor cooling system in the x50 pro 5g to keep the processor cool .
so far we have not had any heating problem in this phone .
however , we have not really tested this phone fully , so we will be able to tell you about it in our review .
in our limited use , we did not find any problems in the phone &apos;s interface or during multitasking .
in the phone you get realme ui , which is based on android 10 .
we have already seen this ui on realme c3 .
the x50 pro 5g also comes with a tremendous 65 watt fast charging , which has been named the realme superdart flash charge .
we have not yet assessed the charging speed , but reality claims that the phone &apos;s battery is fully charged in just 35 minutes .
the back camera setup of the phone matches realme x2 pro to a great extent .
it has a 64-megapixel main camera sensor .
in addition , the setup includes a 12-megapixel telephoto camera , an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera , which also acts as a macro camera , and a 2-megapixel monochrome depth sensor .
the front also features an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with a 32-megapixel main camera , which includes a 105-degree field of view .
so far , we have used the camera very rarely , but after limited time use , our hopes have been raised about the camera .
during limited time use , realme x50 pro 5g has performed exactly the same way as the phone should , according to the specification .
prior to the launch , some rumors claimed that the phone would be launched for around rs 50,000 , but realme surprised everyone by launching it for just rs 37,999 .
however , even though it is the most expensive model of realme till date , the phone still does not have some premium features like wireless charging or water resistance .
we will test the realme x50 pro further in a better way and will give you complete information about its performance , battery life , display , utility etc .
it will also be interesting to see how this phone compares to the iqoo 3 , another premium flagship phone based on the snapdragon 865 processor .
2019 was a great year for chinese smartphone company realme .
the company launched several smartphones every quarter , which proved to be quite successful for the company in the indian market .
with the help of these smartphones , the company also increased competition in the budget and mid-range market in india .
realme started 2020 with the budget smartphone realme 5i and now due to the first quarter of the year , the company also launched its new budget smartphone realme c3 .
the company has introduced this third incarnation of the c-series with many upgraded features and it is equipped with some good hardware at a cheaper price .
the budget smartphone segment is hot in india at the moment .
in such a situation , will realme c3 be able to prove in this segment ? we have tested this new smartphone to find out .
let &apos;s start the review of reality c3 .
realme c3 design reality
has chosen a new design for 2020 , which the company calls sunrise design .
we called it reality 5
but have also seen and now the company called it realme c3
have tried
realme c3 has been introduced in two color options , which include frozen blue and blazing red colors .
for this review we have a variant of frozen blue color .
this color is definitely attractive .
there is texture in the back of the phone , which you can feel in your fingers .
realme has given a larger display than the previous model in c3 .
the display is 6.5-inch in size and has an aspect ratio of 20 : 9 .
this aspect ratio makes the smartphone tall and thin , so it is relatively easy to hold and use .
there are thinner bezels around the display , but the bottom chin is thicker .
like most realme smartphones in the market , reality c3 also comes with waterdrop notch .
the phone &apos;s frame is made of plastic .
the power buttons are on the right and the volume buttons on the left .
the button is set in the right place , making it easy to reach the finger .
however , they lack a bulge , making it difficult to reach them accurately .
the sim tray is provided just above the volume button in reality c3 .
the good thing is that a separate microsd card can also be installed with two sims in it .
the phone has a micro-usb port , 3.5 mm audio jack and a loudspeaker at the bottom .
it is a bit disappointing that in 2020 this phone does not use usb type-c .
nothing is given in the upper part of the frame .
come towards the back .
here you will feel the design of the phone to a great extent like realme 5i .
its camera module also matches realme 5i .
reality c3 has a dual back camera .
the company has given a metal rim around the camera , which protects the lens from scratches .
a 5,000 mah battery has been given in realme c3 , which is rarely seen in phones of this price .
however , the larger battery also increases the weight of this phone .
the phone weighs 195 grams .
realme c3 specifications and software realme c2
in the company had given mediatek &apos;s helio p22 chipset , but here the company has made the biggest change .
realme has given mediatek &apos;s new helio g70 chipset focusing on gaming while making a big jump in c3 .
it is an octa-core processor with a maximum clock speed of 2.0 ghz .
two variants are given in c3 .
its base variant comes with 3 gb ram and 32 gb storage and its second variant has 4 gb ram and 64 gb storage .
the company has also set the price of both these variants correctly .
the base variant costs rs 6,999 and the high-end variant costs rs 7,999 .
as we said , its storage can also be increased through microsd card .
realme c3 is a dual sim smartphone , with support for 4g as well as volte .
connectivity options include bluetooth 5 , wi-fi , five positioning systems and all other common sensors .
like the reality c2 , the reality c3 does not include a fingerprint scanner .
the phone &apos;s software is one place where reality has improved .
reality c3 now runs on coloros like its previous version , instead the company has given realmeui v1.0 , which is based on android 10 .
this is the company &apos;s first smartphone , which comes preloaded with android 10 .
the new realmeui is similar to oppo &apos;s coloros and comes with a lot of changes compared to coloros 6 .
it is very similar to stock android and we liked its layout .
however , the phone still contains some bloatware ( unwanted apps ) , including facebook , halo , dailyhunt , gaana , opera news , uc browser and some realm apps .
the smartphone also has an app market store , which is another option of the google play store .
swiping right from the home screen does not bring a smart assistant or google assistant screen .
yes , universal search is still available in the phone , which has to be swiped down on the home screen to access .
realmeui also includes dark mode .
the phone also has a focus mode , which can be turned on from the notification shade .
like other realme smartphones , this phone is also with game space , which helps you block calls and notifications while gaming .
realme also claims to have a personal information security feature in this phone , which transmits blank or dummy information to apps that request access to your call history , contacts and messages .
being a budget device realme c3 performance and battery life , we were expecting average performance from realme c3 .
however , the device performs well .
we did not see any lag in this phone while scrolling in the menu and multitasking .
let us know that we have tested 4 gb ram variants of this device and it can multitask very easily without killing apps .
we set up face recognition on the device and found that this phone recognizes your face comfortably under whatever light and unlocks the phone .
the display remains bright even in sunny conditions , but would have been better if its viewing angle were also slightly better .
we also played the pubg mobile game in reality c3 .
the graphics are set to hd from the beginning of the game and the settings are also set to high , which is a good thing .
however , after playing for a while , we found a slight lag in the game on these settings .
the performance improved significantly from high to medium setting and the game ran smoothly without any problems .
if you play the game for 15 minutes in high settings , then you will also feel a slight warmth in the display .
the phone comes with a large 5,000 mah battery , which gives excellent battery life .
in our test , this phone ran for about two days on one charge .
during this time we played some games on the phone , used an active whatsapp account and used google chrome for web browsing .
in our hd video loop test , the smartphone has an incredible 28 hours and 20 minutes of battery backup , which no smartphone has given in this test yet .
however , at one place we felt quite disappointed .
of course with a large battery , the company should have provided fast charging support , but reality offers a 10 watt output charger with this phone , which takes two hours to fully charge the battery .
realme c3 cameras reality c3 has a 12-megapixel primary camera , which comes with f / 1.8 aperture .
its second camera is a 2-megapixel depth sensor .
the front has a 5-megapixel selfie camera .
the camera app has changed a lot compared to the previous realme phones .
now it includes portrait , time-lapse , slow-mo , expert and pano modes in addition to photo and video modes .
it also has quick toggles for hdr and chroma boost .
while taking pictures in broad daylight , realme c3 locks focus quickly .
the camera measured the light accurately , which resulted in good pictures in the phone .
however , if you zoom into the camera and take pictures , you will see a lack of detail in the photos .
the quality of the camera can be said to be better according to the price of the phone .
talking of close-up shots , we saw that reality c3 struggled to lock focus when it was too close to the subject .
although the picture is good when the focus is locked .
for portrait mode , it has a depth sensor .
the good thing is that the camera app gives you the option to set the level of blur before taking a picture on this mode .
the realme c3 detects the edges of the subject well but we found the picture a bit flat .
in low light , the realme c3 gives quite average pictures .
the lack of detail and sharpness is evident in them .
realme &apos;s official website initially claimed to include a super nightscape mode feature in the phone , but we did not find it in the camera app .
when we inquired about this , a realme representative confirmed the gadgets 360 and said that it was a mistake and this model does not come with such a mode .
the company later removed it from the website .
talking about selfie , the color tone in the selfie taken outside in daylight is slightly wrong .
the picture also lacked sharpness and detail .
with both the back and front camera , the phone can record video at a maximum resolution of 1080 pixels .
video stabilization is not provided in the camera .
reality c3 detects illumination even in low light at the time of video recording .
this is a good feature according to the phones in this segment .
realme c3 definitely brings stronger features than realme c2 and makes the company &apos;s budget series stronger .
realme has given a powerful chipset in the phone , which gives a good competition to its competitors in terms of performance .
battery life is more powerful than expected and it is impressive that all realme smartphones are successfully surviving our battery test .
of course , the camera performance of reality c3 can not be called the best , but it cannot be called bad according to the price .
buying realme c3 at an initial price of just rs 6,999 can be easily advised .
however , like most of its competitors , reality could offer a fingerprint scanner in this phone .
also we want to see usb type-c also becoming a standard feature .
recently , poco launched its first smartphone poco x2 in india as an independent brand after splitting from xiaomi .
poco was identified with the popular poco f1 .
however , it has been more than a year since that model was launched .
poco is now working on her own .
however , the company will use many of xiaomi &apos;s resources to survive in the market in the near future .
both the specification and the name make it clear that the poco x2 is not an upgrade model of the existing poco f1 .
this phone comes with a significantly different design style than the poco f1 .
even after poco became an independent brand , people are expecting the company to price aggressively compared to other brands , and to an extent the company has managed to do so .
poco x2 for just rs 15,999
its rival realme x2 in the market
takes on the redmi k20 and to some extent
and also makes redmi note 8 pro out of the competition .
what poke
will the indian market once again create panic , and will its new phone usher in a new era of competition ? to know the answer to all these questions , let &apos;s start a review of the company &apos;s new weapon poco x2 .
poco x2 design in order to keep the price to a minimum , xiaomi gave poco f1
the phone is made of simple plastic , due to which the phone appears largely plain .
on the other hand , with poco x2 , poco is trying a different approach .
in the new phone , we get a bright , colorful glass back with gradient finish .
apart from this , a circular design around the camera module also gives the phone a completely different look .
we had the atlantis blue color unit of the phone to review .
however you can also buy poco x2 in phoenix red or matrix purple color .
poko &apos;s branding is given in the back of the phone .
the center of attraction in the design of the poco x2 is the circular design around its camera module .
this design looks 3d and at first glance you will feel as if there is a circular load around the camera module .
the camera module has four cameras set .
the camera module is slightly more bumpy than necessary .
with a 6.67-inch screen , it is undoubtedly a big phone .
however the 20 : 9 aspect ratio of the display makes it somewhat easier to use .
despite being shiny , its back panel is not slippery , due to which it has a good grip .
however , when using the phone with one hand , it may be a bit difficult for you to access all parts of the screen with the thumb .
the wide cutout given for the two selfie cameras in the top right corner of the screen can grab your attention many times .
in normal use , it won &apos;t bother you much , but can definitely reduce your experience a bit while watching full screen video .
the fingerprint sensor is also fitted in the power button on the right side of the phone , but it is long and thin , which is not good in my eyes .
this makes the fingerprint register process take longer than normal .
users who use the phone with their left hand will find this fingerprint setup a bit strange .
the volume buttons are set above the power button , due to which it is sometimes difficult to access them with one hand .
like most xiaomi phones , an infrared sensor has been given at the top of the phone .
the sim tray on the left side of the x2 is hybrid , so if you want to install a microsd card , you will have to sacrifice your second sim .
the 3.5 mm audio socket , usb type-c port and speaker are provided at the bottom .
poco says that x2 uses gorilla glass 5 at the front as well as at the rear .
along with the phone , the company also offers a transparent case , which can to some extent protect the phone from minor scratches .
apart from this , you also get a sim tray ejecting pin in the phone box , a 27 watt charger and a usb type-c cable .
overall , it seems that poco wanted to differentiate itself as a brand with this phone .
we cannot directly say that the design of the phone is absolutely the best , but this phone is definitely unique from the front and back .
however , we would have liked this phone with a slightly less bright color .
poco x2 specifications and software as we have said earlier , poco x2 cannot be considered an upgrade of poco f1 .
even the company has not tried to offer this phone like poco f1 at a lower price with flagship grade features .
however , in this phone you will find qualco mm snapdragon 730g chipset
which is a good thing .
this chipset is also given by poco &apos;s rival brand realme in reality x2 .
from this we can deduce that poco x2 will be good in terms of general usage and gaming .
you can buy poco x2 &apos;s 6 gb ram and 64 gb storage variants for rs 15,999 .
its 6 gb ram and 128 gb storage variants are being sold for rs 16,999 and the high-end variants are priced at rs 19,999 , in which you will get 8 gb ram and 256 gb storage .
we have a high-end variant of the phone for review and if you buy this variant you will not need to worry about storage and you can use your two sims freely .
the phone has a 6.67-inch ( 2340x1080 pixels ) display , which supports a 120hz refresh rate .
this is one of the biggest features of the phone and there is no doubt that the 120hz refresh rate improves the quality of the display and the experience of using it .
the android ui feels very smooth and responsive in this .
the highest benefit of high refresh rate is given to games , but the best experience can be enjoyed only in games that support 120hz refresh rate .
apart from this , hdr-10 is also included in a big feature of the display .
the phone has a large 4500 mah capacity battery , dual volte , wi-fi 802.11ac , bluetooth 5 , gps , fm radio and all the necessary sensors .
even the maximum features present in poco x2 redmi k30 launched in china
match with .
poco &apos;s ui can be called both poco launcher and miui 11.0.3 .
in terms of looks and experience , it is very similar to the ui seen in redmi k20 and k20 pro .
it is based on android 10 and it has been updated with the december 2019 security patch , which is a good thing .
xiaomi &apos;s software has always been a point of concern .
most of the xiaomi users are very upset with the unwanted apps filled in the phone , pop-ups and notifications , and now poco has followed this path .
many unwanted apps are pre-installed in the phone .
apart from this , many unwanted notifications every day will force you to download apps from the company &apos;s own getapps store .
not only this , promotional messages appear on the lock screen .
however you can turn it off .
you will see promotional content in many default apps included in the phone .
however , compared to other phones of xiaomi , the ads and pop-ups in poco x2 have been kept slightly lower .
poco x2 has some differences compared to the software coming in xiaomi phones .
this phone comes with an app drawer , in which apps are set in several different categories .
on opening the drawer , a search bar also comes down , through which the user can directly search the app .
apart from this , the phone also includes many special apps like game turbo optimization mode , quick reply panel for messaging apps and second space for privacy .
the poco x2 performance and battery life snapdragon 730g is a good processor .
poco x2 handled all the apps with ease thanks to this processor .
we did see a slight lag in the phone &apos;s ui once or twice , but it did not appear to be a problem .
multi-tasking is very comfortable in the phone .
however , please remember that we have tested the 8 gb ram variant of this phone .
we had only one problem while using this phone , which was difficult to reach every part of the phone .
the phone does not have the problem of over-heating .
however , while playing a game or using a camera , the phone is slightly warm .
the display is not very vivid or sharp .
however it is quite bright and attractive and looks good from every angle .
the wide dual-camera cutout included on the front of the phone may spoil your experience during some activities .
however , it depends on the user .
the maximum time did not bother us with this wide cutout , but when watching the video , this cutout in the scene with sharp brightness is quite noticeable , which can make your experience somewhat gritty .
a little color bleeding is also seen around this cutout .
the bottom has a single speaker , but it is quite sharp and the quality of its sound output is also good .
in this , above 60 percent the volume sounds a bit torn , but in low volume the sound is good .
in poco x2 , pubg mobile runs by default in high settings .
the game experience is quite good .
you can easily play games like pubg mobile or asphalt 9 without any lag in it .
the battery life of the poco x2 is fine .
this phone can easily take out your day in ordinary use .
throughout the day , we used the camera multiple times , played a few rounds of pubg mobile games , streamed video for about an hour and spent some time on social media apps .
after all this , the phone took the rest of the day comfortably from morning to night .
in our hd video loop test , this phone ran for 13 hours , 43 minutes , which is not an impressive result .
however , it should also be kept in mind that the phone &apos;s display is quite large and it works at 120 hz .
poco x2 cameras the poco x2 includes four rear cameras and two front cameras .
the back has a 64-megapixel main camera sensor , which has an aperture size f / 1.89 and is a somi imx686 sensor .
its second camera is an 8-megapixel ultra wide-angle lens with f / 2.2 aperture .
the third camera is a 2-megapixel macro lens , which supports 2cm-10cm focal range and comes with autofocus .
the fourth camera is a 2-megapixel depth sensor .
on the front side , it includes a 20-megapixel main camera and a 2-megapixel depth sensor .
the camera app of poco x2 has a separate button upwards to go from normal to macro mode .
the bottom right and left have several modes , including 64-megapixel mode , pro , portrait , night , short video and slow motion modes .
the most disappointing thing is that poco &apos;s watermark already comes in the camera app and we request all brands not to do so .
many times , we had to work hard to lock the focus in the main camera .
however the exposure in the photos was quite good and the colors have also improved .
the details of many subjects have also come very well .
for example , with good light and good focus , there is a good amount of detail in the flower leaves .
however , as the illumination is low , pictures begin to show a lack of detail .
as we expected , the wide-angle camera of the phone takes pictures of very poor quality .
however , compared to other phones , the edges of pictures taken with this lens are not rounded .
taking a macro shot in the phone is also quite difficult .
most photos are quite dull or blurry .
the camera performs better than expected in low light .
the camera performs well even in artificial light .
in this night mode , you can increase the quality of the camera slightly in low light and there is a difference between normal photos and pictures taken in night mode .
you can also take portrait selfie in the front camera of the phone and in this you can also set the blur of the background according to yourself .
the camera also detects the subject &apos;s age well .
however , the performance of the front camera is not too impressive .
in the selfie taken in daylight , the background is quite bright , due to which the selfie looks very strange at times .
talking about video , we liked the video recording capability of poco x2 in the light of day .
the video is very crisp and motion tracking is also very smooth .
the lack of consistency in the video is also not felt .
however , as soon as it comes to 4k settings , this performance changes from good to straightforward bad .
the videos show excessively .
while recording the video at night , even if the phone is lightly shaken , the video has the effect of twinkling .
exposure problem is also seen in the video when there is strong light at night .
overall , it is very difficult to record good 4k video in poco x2 at night time .
offering high-end specifications in the indian market at a low price can lead any smartphone brand to success and xiaomi
this game has been playing successfully for years .
the company has introduced many such models in the last few years , which are gaining value for money .
the price of the poco x2 is its biggest weapon .
realme x2 and redmi 20 have dominated the sub-rs 20,000 market .
many such phones have been launched in this segment , which have not been able to beat both these phones , even though that oppo f15
and be vivo s1 pro , both in terms of phone power and features realme x2
and redmi k20
stayed behind from
now poco x2 can deposit its coin in this competition .
processor , ram , storage , battery and camera in all cases , this phone is very strong and its build quality cannot be questioned .
however its software filled with unwanted apps and notifications has definitely disappointed us a bit .
its back panel also seems excessively shiny , but it depends on the user &apos;s own taste .
apart from this , customers who want some small hand or compact size phones may find this phone a bit big .
if the price means a lot to you , then the poco x2 is a great option in its segment .
however , this sentence does not mean that poco x2 is better than its rival realme x2 in every respect .
if you get reality x2 at a low price in a cell or you are finding it difficult to buy poco x2 in a flash cell , then you can also look at reality x2 as a good option .

samsung is rapidly expanding its a-series lineup in 2020 with some new models .
in this lineup , the company added galaxy a71 and galaxy a51 smartphones at the beginning of the year .
the galaxy a51 is launched in india for rs 23,999 .
to keep the series fresh and fresh , samsung has introduced the galaxy a51 by making some improvements to the existing galaxy a50s .
according to samsung , the galaxy a51 smartphone is the first smartphone of this series to come with an infinity-o display and a macro camera sport at rs 23,999 .
apart from these highlighted features , many of its specifications are similar to the existing galaxy a50s , including amoled display , processor and design etc .
redmi k20 pro ( rs 24,999 ) and redmi k20
apart from this , the samsung galaxy a51 does not give any other smartphone competition in this price , which can prove to be an advantage for samsung .
so will this new lower mid-range smartphone prove to be better than the current competition ? let &apos;s take a look .
samsung galaxy a51 design samsung
the design of the galaxy a51 matches the galaxy a50s .
its body is made of polycarbonate and weighs just 172g .
along with this , the phone also seems quite thin .
its thickness is just 7.9  mm .
the fingerprints on its shiny back are easily printed .
however , these marks are not much visible on the prism black color variants present near hamre .
the finish of the back panel is a bit slippery , but thankfully samsung offers a case cover in the box of this phone for free .
galaxy a51 compared to galaxy a50s
the biggest change in is the infinity-o display , which we are seeing for the first time on galaxy a-series phones .
samsung has named the whole-punch display as infiniti-o .
this hole-punch galaxy note 10 + in this phone
like , the center of the display is given in the middle .
samsung may not have changed the design of the body of the phone too much , but having a hole-punch display gives this phone a premium look , which we appreciate .
the galaxy a51 uses a full-hd + resolution super amoled panel , which gives punchy colors and good sharpness .
due to the thin bezel all around , its display looks great from the front .
buttons on the galaxy a51 also fit well .
it has a card tray on the right side , in which two nano-sim cards and a microsd card can be fitted .
the 3.5 mm headphone socket , usb type-c port and speaker grill are given at the bottom .
the rear of the galaxy a51 has four cameras setup .
the good thing is that its camera bump is not very bulge .
apart from the phone in the box of samsung galaxy a51 , there is a 15 watt fast charger , a type-c cable , a headset , a sim tray eject pin and a cover .
samsung galaxy a51 specifications and software in samsung galaxy a51 , the company has given the exynos 9611 processor included in the current galaxy a50s , which in 2020 and at this price , makes the phone feel a little weak .
the galaxy a51 is launched with 6 gb ram and 8 gb ram options .
both variants have 128 gb of internal storage .
apart from this , the phone includes dual-band wi-fi 802.11 ac , bluetooth 5 , gps , nfc and fm radio etc .
all the common sensors are present in this phone .
the galaxy a51 also has widewin l1 certification .
this phone supports samsung pay , so you can also use it for contactless payment .
the galaxy a51 has a one ui 2.0 based on android 10 .
this new version is similar to the previous version of one ui , which we have used before .
however , the company has made some changes to make it better for the user experience .
instead of sending them to the theme , it now allows the ui user to change the wallpaper directly from the dedicated menu .
apart from this , now the &apos; device care &apos; sub-menu has also been given a new look .
battery usage information can now be tracked for the last seven days instead of the last full charge .
now you can also change the lockscreen app icon .
as before , this version still has some bloatware ( unwanted apps ) pre-installed , including third-party apps and some samsung apps , but most of them can be removed easily .
samsung has also added some india-specific features to the galaxy a51 .
in this , the user can now convert sms into a visual card .
apart from this , multilingual predictive typing and smart crops are also included .
samsung galaxy a51 performance and battery life the galaxy a51 feels very similar to the galaxy a50 in day-to-day use .
we liked its slimness and light form factor .
its interface is fast to navigate , but it does not give a smooth feel .
sometimes we have also seen lag in its system animations .
its benchmark performance also does not affect much by qualco mm snapdragon 660 or 665 chipset .
overall , it is slightly lower according to the price of this phone .
biometric authentication works well , but is a bit slow .
its in-display fingerprint sensor takes a little time to authenticate fingerprint and unlock the phone , and some similar face unlock feature is also available .
the galaxy a51 comes with dolby atmos support , but this feature only works when you use headphones .
the audio quality of the earphones that comes with it gives an average feel .
however , this phone offers better audio with some high-grade earphones available in the market .
the output of the speaker below is not much , but enough for listening alone .
one of the best parts of this phone is its display .
the brightness of the display is quite good and colors look good in it .
because of this , there is a good experience in watching videos in the phone .
the samsung galaxy a51 has a battery of 4,000 mah capacity .
this battery lasted 14 hours and 55 minutes in our hd video loop test .
on regular use , this phone ran smoothly throughout the day and with the end of the day , it had a battery lasting for half a day .
fast charging support has been provided in this phone .
upon examining us , we found that the phone charger can charge it up to 67 percent in an hour .
it takes more than two hours to fully charge .
although it is fast , but it is slightly slower than other phones in the segment .
for example , the redmi k20 pro charges up to 80 percent in one hour .
samsung galaxy a51 cameras samsung has added an additional 5-megapixel macro sensor to the new galaxy a51 phone compared to the triple camera setup included in the galaxy a50s .
the other three cameras include a 48-megapixel main sensor , a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera , and a 5-megapixel depth sensor .
the camera app in one ui 2.0 has also been slightly improved compared to earlier .
most shooting modes are now stored together in the &quot; more &quot; menu .
